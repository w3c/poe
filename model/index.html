    <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for representing statements about the usage of content and services. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL policies. </p>
	
        <p>Policies are used to represent permitted and prohibited actions over a certain asset, as well as the obligations required to be meet by stakeholders. In addition, policies may be limited by constraints (e.g., temporal or spatial constraints) and duties (e.g. payments) may be imposed on permissions. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>   

<p>Several business scenarios require expressing what are the permitted and prohibited actions over  resources. These permitted/prohibited actions are usually expressed under the form of policies, i.e., expressions that indicate those uses and re-uses of the content which are conformant with  existing regulations or to the constraints assigned by the owner. Policies may also be enriched with additional information, i.e., who are the entities in charge of the definition of such Policy and those who are required to conform to it, what are the additional constrains to be associated with the Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties expressed by the Policy. The ability to express these concepts and relationships is important both for the producers of content, i.e., they may state in a clear way what are the permitted and the prohibited actions to prevent misuse, and for the consumers, i.e., they may know precisely what resources they are allowed to use and re-use to avoid breaking any rules, laws or the owner's constraints. This specification describes a common approach to expressing these policy concepts.</p>
<p>The ODRL Information Model defines the underlying semantic model for permission, prohibition, and obligation statements describing content usage. The information model covers the core concepts, entities and relationships that provide the foundational model for content usage statements. These machine-readable policies may be linked directly with the content they are associated to with the aim to allow consumers to easily retrieve this information.</p>
     
<section id="aimsModel">
<h3>Aims of the Model</h3>

<p>The primary aim of the ODRL Information Model is to provide a standard description model and format to express permission, prohibition, and obligation statements to be associated to content in general. These statements are employed to describe the terms of use and reuse of resources. The model should cover as many permission, prohibition, and obligation use cases as possible, while keeping the policy modeling easy even when dealing with complex cases.</p>

<p>The ODRL Information Model is a single, consistent model that can be used by all interested parties. A single method of fulfilling a use case is strongly preferred over multiple methods, unless there are existing standards that need to be accommodated or there is a significant cost associated with using only a single method. While the ODRL Information Model is built using Linked Data principles, the design is intended to allow non-graph-based implementations. </p>

<h2>ODRL Information Model</h2>

<p>The ODRL Information Model represents Policies that express Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties related to the usage of Asset resources. The Information Model explicitly expresses what is allowed and what is not allowed by the Policy, as well as other terms, requirements, and parties involved. The aim of the ODRL Information Model is to enable flexible Policy expressions by allowing the policy author to include as much, or as little, detail in the Policies.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Information Model.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="00Model.png" alt="ODRL Information Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Information Model (Also available in <a href="00Model.svg">SVG format</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

  
    
<p>The ODRL Information Model has the following classes:
    <ul>
        <li><code>Policy</code> - A non-empty group of Permissions (via the permission property) and/or Prohibitions (via the prohibition property) and/or Duties (via the obligation property). The Policy class is the parent class to the Set, Offer, and Agreement subclasses:</li>
        <ul>
        <li><code>Set</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports expressing generic Rules.</li>
        <li><code>Offer</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports offerings of Rules from assigner Parties.</li>
        <li><code>Agreement</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports granting of Rules from assigner to assignee Parties. </li>
        </ul>
    <li><code>Asset</code> - A resource or a collection of resources that are the subject of a Rule (via the abstract <em>relation</em> property). The Asset class is the parent class to:</li>
         <ul>
        <li><code>AssetCollection</code> - a subclass of Asset that identifies a collection of resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><code>Party</code> - An entity or a collection of entities that undertake Roles in a Rule (via the abstract <em>function</em> property). The Party class is the parent class to:</li>
         <ul>
        <li><code>PartyCollection</code> - a subclass of Party that identifies a collection of entities.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><code>Action</code> - An operation on an Asset.</li>
    <li><code>Rule</code> - An abstract concept that represents the common characteristics of Permissions, Prohibitions, and Duties.</li>
        <ul>
    <li><code>Permission</code> - The ability to exercise an Action over an Asset. The Permission MAY also have the <strong>duty</strong> property that expresses an agreed Action that MUST be exercised (as a pre-condition to be granted the Permission).</li>
    <li><code>Prohibition</code> - The inability to exercise an Action over an Asset.</li>
    <li><code>Duty</code> - The obligation to exercise an Action.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><code>Constraint/LogicalConstraint</code> - A boolean/logical expression that refines an Action and Party/Asset collection or the conditions applicable to a Rule.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The ODRL Information Model includes property relationships between the classes. Most are explicitly named properties and some are abstract properties (specifically, <em>relation</em>, <em>function</em>, <em>operand</em>, and <em>failure</em>). The abstract properties are generic parent properties that are designed to be represented by  child properties (sub-types) with explicit semantics. </p>

	<p>For example, the two properties <em>relation</em> and <em>function</em> in Figure 1 are designed to represent the <em>conceptual</em> relation between the Rule and the Asset and Party classes.

		The figure shows the <em>relation</em> property with subtype <code>target</code> to express that the Asset is the primary subject of the Rule. The <em>function</em> property has subtype <code>assigner</code> to express the Party issuing the Rule, and subtype <code>assignee</code> to express the recipient Party of the Rule. 
</p> 
    
    
<div class="note">
<p>The ODRL Information Model provides a <em>logical view</em> of the components of the Policy model. The <em>implementable view</em> of the ODRL Information Model is provided by various encoding serialisations as normatively described in the ODRL Vocabulary &amp; Expression document [[odrl-vocab]]. The mapping of the logical Information Model components to the implementable serialisations may require some trade-offs and/or differences depending on the features supported by the serialisation language.</p>
</div>
    
<p>The following sections provide further details on the ODRL Information Model. </p>

<section id="policy">
<h3>Policy Class</h3>

<p>The Policy class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Policy MUST have one <code>uid</code> property value (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the Policy.</li>
<li>A Policy MUST have at least one <code>permission</code>, <code>prohibition</code>, or <code>obligation</code> property values of type Rule.  (See the <a href="#permission">Permission</a>,  <a href="#prohibition">Prohibition</a>, and <a href="#duty-policy">Obligation</a> sections for more details.)</li>
<li>A Policy MAY have none, one, or many <code>profile</code> property values (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the ODRL Profile that this Policy conforms to. (See the <a href="#profile">ODRL Profiles</a> section for more details.)</li>
	
<li>A Policy MAY have none, one, or many <code>inheritFrom</code> property values (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the parent Policy from which this child Policy inherits from. (See the <a href="#inheritance">ODRL Inheritance</a> section for more details.) </li>
	
	
<li>A Policy MAY have none or one <code>conflict</code> property values (of type ConflictTerm) for Conflict Strategy Preferences indicating how to handle Policy conflicts.(See the <a href="#conflict">Policy Conflict Strategy</a> section for more details.)</li>

</ul>
	
<p>
	An ODRL Policy MAY also declare properties which are shared and common to all its Rules. Specifically; <code>action</code> properties, sub-properties of <code>relation</code> (such as <code>target</code>), and sub-properties of <code>function</code> (such as <code>assigner</code> and <code>assignee</code>).
	See section <a href="#composition-compact">Compact Policy</a> for validation requirements on these shared properties.
</p>
	
	
	<p>An ODRL Policy must either:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Only use terms defined in the ODRL Core Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]], or</li>
	<li>Use an ODRL Profile that declares the supported vocabulary used by expressions in the Policy.</li>
	</ul>
<p>In the former case, the profile property MUST NOT be used. In the latter case, the profile property MUST be used to indicate the IRIs of the ODRL Profile(s). 
	See the <a href="#profile">ODRL Profiles</a> section for more details on mechanisms to define ODRL Profiles and conformance requirements. (The Examples in this document will use ODRL Profile identifiers for illustrative purposes only.) </p>

	
<p>An ODRL Policy MAY be subclassed to more precisely describe the <em>context</em> of use of the 
	Policy that MAY include additional constraints that ODRL processors MUST understand. Additional Policy subclasses MAY be documented in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] or in ODRL Profiles. 
    
<section id="policy-set">
<h3>Set Class</h3> 

    <p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Set</code> represents any combination of Rules. The <code>Set</code> Policy subclass is also the default subclass of Policy (if none is specified).</p>
	

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below <code>Set</code> Policy shows the Permission to <code>use</code> the target Asset <code>http//example.com/asset:9898.movie</code>.</p>

    </div>
    
</section>

<section id="policy-offer">
<h3>Offer Class</h3> 

<p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Offer</code> represents Rules that are being offered from assigner Parties. An <code>Offer</code> is typically used to make available Policies to a wider audience, but does not grant any Rules.</p>
    
    <p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Offer</code>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MUST have one <code>assigner</code> property value (of type Party) to indicate the functional role in the same Rules.</li>
    </ul>
	
	<p>Note: See the <a href="#function">Function Property</a> section for details on the functional roles.</p>
	
 
	<p>Note: The above property cardinalities reflect the normative ODRL Information Model. In some cases, repeat occurrences of some properties are also supported (as described in <a href="#composition">Policy Rule Composition</a> and <a href="#composition-compact">Compact Policy</a>) but the normative atomic Policy is consistent with the above property cardinalities.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Agreement Class</h3> 

<p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Agreement</code> represents Rules that have been granted from assigner to assignee Parties. An <code>Agreement</code> is typically used to grant the terms of the Rules between the Parties.</p>
    
    <p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Agreement</code>:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>MUST have one <code>assigner</code> property value (of type Party) to indicate the functional role in the same Rules.</li>

<section id="asset">
<h3>Asset Class</h3>
<p>An Asset class is a resource or a collection of resources that are the subject of a Rule. The Asset can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, services, or physical artefacts. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> classes that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with a Duty. An Asset is referred to by the Permission and/or Prohibition, and also by the Duty.</p>
 
<p>The Asset class has the following subclass:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li><code>AssetCollection</code> - an Asset that is a collection of resources. This indicates that all the items in the collection will be the subject of the Rule.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>The Asset class has the following properties:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>An Asset SHOULD have one <code>uid</code> property value (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the Asset.</li>
	
    <li>An Asset MAY have none, one, or many <code>partOf</code> property values (of type AssetCollection) to identify the AssetCollection that this Asset is in a collection of.</li>
<li>An AssetCollection MAY have none, one, or many <code>refinement</code> property values of type Constraint. See <a href="#constraint-asset">Refinement property with an Asset Collection</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
    
    <p class="note">If an Asset does not assert an identifier using the <code>uid</code> property, then the full implications must be understood, such as the impact on ODRL Validators and Evaluators of ODRL Policies.</p>
    
<p>Since ODRL Policies could deal with any kind of Asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe Assets of particular media types. It is recommended to use  existing metadata standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> that are appropriate to the Asset type or purpose.</p>

<section id="relation">
<h4>Relation Property</h4>

<p>The abstract <code><em>relation</em></code> property is used to create an explicit link between an Action and an Asset, indicating how the Asset MUST be utilised in respect to the Rule that links to it.</p>

    <p>An ODRL validator MUST support the following sub-properties of <code><em>relation</em></code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>target</code>: indicates that the Asset is the primary subject to which the Rule action directly applies.</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>Additional <code><em>relation</em></code> subtype properties MAY be defined in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>
    
        
 <blockquote>   
<p>Example Use Case: The assigner Party <code>http//example.com/party:0001</code> offers to display the <code>target</code> Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:3333</code>.</p>

<section id="asset-partof">
<h3>Part Of Property</h3> 	

<p>The <code>partOf</code> property is used to identify an AssetCollection that an Asset resource is a member of. The purpose is to explicitly express membership relationships between Assets and AssetCollections.  This enables a Rule that is related to an AssetCollection to understand which individual Assets the Rule may apply to. In addition, the Asset/AssetCollection membership relationships may potentially detect conflicts in Rules.</p>
	
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below snippet shows some Dublin Core metadata describing a document. The <code>odrl:partOf</code> property asserts that the Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:111.doc</code> is a member of the <code>http://example.com/archive1011</code> AssetCollection which is used in the Policy in the example above. This means that <code>http://example.com/asset:111.doc</code> is one of the target Assets in the Policy and can my indexed.</p>

<section id="policy-has">
<h3>Target Policy Property</h3> 
		   
<p>An ODRL Policy class MAY also be referenced by the <code>hasPolicy</code> property. This supports ODRL Policy Rules being the object of external metadata expressions (that identifies an Asset). When <code>hasPolicy</code> has been asserted between a metadata expression and an ODRL Policy, the Asset being identified MUST be inferred to be the <code>target</code> Asset of all the Rules of that Policy. If there are multiple Rules in the Policy, then the inferred Asset will be the target Asset to <strong>every</strong> Rule in the Policy.</p>
        
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below snippet shows some Dublin Core metadata describing a movie Asset. The <code>odrl:hasPolicy</code> property links to the ODRL Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:1010</code> (this is the Set Policy described above). In this case, the Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:9999.movie</code> is now also the target Asset for the Permission in Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:1010</code>. If there were additional Rules in this Policy, then the same Asset would be the target Asset to each Rule.</p>

<h3>Party Class </h3>
    
<p>A Party Class is an entity or a collection of entities that undertake functional roles in a Rule, such as a person, collection of people, organisation, or agent. An agent is a person or thing that takes an active role or produces a specified effect. The Party performs (or does not perform) Actions or has a function in a Duty (i.e., assigns the Party to the Rule by associating it with the function it plays in the Rule).</p>

<p>The Party class has the following subclass:</p> 
<ul>
    <li><code>PartyCollection</code> - a Party that is a collection of entities. This indicates that all the entities in the collection will undertake the same functional role in the Rule.</li>

<li>A Party SHOULD have one <code>uid</code> property value (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the Party.</li>
	
   <li>A Party MAY have none, one, or many <code>partOf</code> property values (of type PartyCollection) to identify the PartyCollection that this Party is a member of.</li>
<li>A PartyCollection MAY have none, one, or many <code>refinement</code> property values of type Constraint. See <a href="#constraint-party">Refinement property with a Party Collection</a> for more details.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">If a Party does not assert an identifier using the <code>uid</code> property, then the full implications must be understood, such as the impact on ODRL Validators and Evaluators of ODRL Policies.</p>
    

<p>The ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata for the Party class. It is recommended to use existing metadata standards, such as the W3C vCard Ontology [[vcard-rdf]] or FOAF Vocabulary [[foaf]].</p>
 
    
<section id="function">
<h4>Function Property</h4>

<p>A <code><em>function</em></code> property is used to link a Rule to a Party, indicating the function undertaken by the Party in respect to the Rule that links to it. The <code><em>function</em></code> property itself is abstract; sub-properties represent explicit semantics of the functional role between the Party and the Rule.</p>
 
<p>An ODRL validator MUST support the following sub-properties of <code><em>function</em></code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assigner</code>: indicates the Party that is issuing the Rule. For example, the Party granting a Permission or requiring an agreed Duty to be fulfilled.</li>
<li><code>assignee</code>: indicates that the Party that is the recipient the Rule. For example, the Party being granted a Permission or required to fulfil an agreed Duty.</li>
</ul>
 
    <p>Additional <code><em>function</em></code> subtype properties MAY be defined in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>
    

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The Policy shows an Agreement with two Parties with the functional roles of the <code>assigner</code> and the <code>assignee</code>. The <code>assigner</code> grants the <code>assignee</code> the play action over the target asset.</p>

<h3>Part Of Property</h3> 	
	
<p>The <code>partOf</code> property is used to identify a PartyCollection that a Party entity is a member of. The purpose is to explicitly express membership relationships between Parties and PartyCollections.  This enables a Rule that relates to a PartyCollection to understand which individual Parties the Rule may apply to. In addition, the Party/PartyCollection membership relationships may potentially detect conflicts in Rules.</p>
	
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below snippet shows some vCard metadata describing a Party. The <code>odrl:partOf</code> property asserts that the Party <code>http://example.com/person/murphy</code> is a member of the <code>http://example.com/team/A</code> PartyCollection which is used in the Policy in the example above. This means that <code>http://example.com/person/murphy</code> is an assignee and can use the target asset in the Policy. </p>

<h3>Assigned Policy Properties</h3> 
		   
<p>An ODRL Policy class MAY also be referenced by the <code>assignerOf</code> and  <code>assigneeOf</code> properties. This supports ODRL Policy Rules being the object of external metadata expressions (that identifies a Party). When <code>assignerOf</code> has been asserted between a metadata expression and an ODRL Policy, the Party being identified MUST be inferred to undertake the <code>assigner</code> functional role of all the Rules of that Policy. When <code>assigneeOf</code> has been asserted between a metadata expression and an ODRL Policy, the Party being identified MUST be inferred to undertake the <code>assignee</code> functional role of all the Rules of that Policy.
	
	If there are multiple Rules in the Policy, then the inferred Party will undertake the functional role  to <strong>every</strong> Rule in the Policy.</p>

<section id="action">
<h3>Action Class</h3>


    <p>An Action class indicates an operation that can be exercised on an Asset. An Action is associated with the Asset via the action property in a Rule.</p>
    
    <p>The Rule provides the specific interpretations of the Action. For example; an Action is <em>permitted</em> to be exercised on the target Asset when related to a Permission. When related to a Prohibition, the Action indicates the operation that is <em>prohibited</em> to be exercised on the target Asset. When related to a Duty, the Action indicates the agreed operation that is <em>obligatory</em> to be fulfilled by a Party</p>
    
    <p>The ODRL Information Model defines the following top-level Actions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>use</code> - actions that involve general usage by parties. </li>
        <li><code>transfer</code> - actions that involve in the transfer of ownership to third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Action class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An Action MAY have none, one or more <code>refinement</code> property values (of type Constraint) that refine the semantics of the Action operation. See <a href="#constraint">Constraints</a> section for more details.</li>
	
<li>An Action (except for use and transfer) MUST have one <code>includedIn</code> property value (of type Action) to transitively assert this Action that encompasses its operational semantics.</li>
<li>An Action MAY have none, one or more <code>implies</code> property values (of type Action) to assert this Action is not prohibited to enable its operational semantics.</li>    
</ul>
    
    <p>
     Action terms MUST be defined using the <code>includedIn</code> property referring to an encompassing Action and either <code>use</code> or <code>transfer</code> as the top-level parent term by transitive means.
      
        
        The purpose of the <code>includedIn</code> property is to explicitly assert that the semantics of the referenced instance of an other Action encompasses (includes) the semantics of this instance of Action. The <code>includedIn</code> property is transitive, and as such, the Actions form ancestor relationships.  </p>
        
       <p>The implication of the <code>includedIn</code> property is that a Permission or Prohibition of an encompassing Action is inherited by all Actions with an <code>includedIn</code> relationship.
        
         For example, if the <code>play</code> Action is defined as <code>includedIn</code> with <code>use</code> then if <code>play</code> is permitted in a Policy and <code>use</code> is prohibited in the same Policy - and both Actions apply to the same target Asset -  then because of this asserted relationship between the two, there is conflict in the Policy. (See <a href="#conflict">Policy Conflict Strategy</a> for more details.)</p>
        
        
     <p>       
         The <code>implies</code> property asserts that an instance of Action entails that the other instance of Action is not prohibited.  The <code>implies</code> property can establish such an assertion between two Action instances if they don't have an <code>includedIn</code> relationship.
         
         For example, if a <code>share</code> Action implies explicitly the <code>distribute</code> Action, then if <code>share</code> is permitted in a Policy and <code>distribute</code> is prohibited in the same Policy - and both Actions apply to the same target Asset - this would cause a conflict in the Policy. If an implied other action is not prohibited then this will not cause a conflict.
         (See <a href="#conflict">Policy Conflict Strategy</a> for more details.)
    
    <p>See <a href="#profile">ODRL Profiles</a> for usage details on the <code>includedIn</code> and <code>implies</code> properties.
    </p>
    
<p>The ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] defines a standard set of generic Actions that MAY be adopted by ODRL Profiles.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The Policy expresses an Offer for the target Asset <code>http://example.com/music:1012</code> with the Action to <code>play</code> the Asset (<code>play</code> is defined as an <code>includedIn</code> term of <code>use</code>).</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
    
    <p>Constraints are boolean/logical expressions that can be used to refine the semantics of an Action and Party/Asset Collection or declare the conditions applicable to a Rule. Constraints can be represented as a <strong> Constraint</strong> class or <strong>Logical Constraint</strong> class. A Logical Constraint will refer to existing Constraints as its operands. When multiple Constraints apply to the same Rule, Action, Party/Asset Collection, then they are interpreted as conjunction and all MUST be satisfied.</p>

	
<p>The Constraint and Logical Constraint classes form semantic and conditional relationships with the Party Collection, Asset Collection, Action, and Rule classes. The property relationships are summarised in the figure below.</p>

    <figcaption>ODRL Constraint Relationships (Also available in <a href="01Constraint.svg">SVG format</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

	
    
<section id="constraint-class">
<h3>Constraint Class</h3>
        
<p>A Constraint class is used for expressions which compare two operands (which are not Constraints) by one relational operator. If the comparison returns a match the Constraint is <strong>satisfied</strong>, otherwise it is <strong>not satisfied</strong>. The Constraint class formulates a comparison expression, such as, the number of usages (the <code>leftOperand</code>) must be smaller than (the <code>operator</code>) the number 10 (the <code>rightOperand</code>). 
</p>
       
<p>The Constraint class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Constraint MUST have one <code>leftOperand</code> property value of type LeftOperand.</li>
<li>A Constraint MUST have one <code>operator</code> property value of type Operator.</li>
<li>A Constraint MUST have either:
	<ul>
	<li>one <code>rightOperand</code> property value of type:
		<ul>
		  <li>literal, or IRI [[!rfc3987]], or RightOperand; or</li>
		  <li>for set-based operators; list of literals, or list of IRIs [[!rfc3987]], or list of RightOperands;</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>one <code>rightOperandReference</code> property value of type:
		<ul>
		  <li>IRI [[!rfc3987]]; or</li>
		  <li>for set-based operators; list of IRIs [[!rfc3987]];</li>
		</ul>
		for a reference to a right operand value.</li>
	</ul>
<li>A Constraint MAY have none or one <code>dataType</code> property value for the data type of the rightOperand/Reference.</li>
	
<li>A Constraint MAY have none or one <code>unit</code> property value (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to set the unit used for the value of the rightOperand/Reference.</li>
	
<li>A Constraint MAY have none or one <code>status</code> property value for a value generated from the leftOperand action or for a value related to the leftOperand set as the reference for the comparison.</li>
</ul>     
    
<p>The <code>leftOperand</code> property values are defined as instances of the LeftOperand class. The <code>leftOperand</code> instances MUST clearly be  <strong>defined</strong> to indicate the semantics of the Constraint, and MAY declare how the value for comparison has to be retrieved or generated. The ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] defines <code>leftOperand</code>'s that MAY be used by ODRL Profiles.</p>
    
<p>The <code>operator</code> property values are defined as instances of the Operator class. The <code>operator</code> instances identify the relational operation such as &#8220;greater than&#8221; or &#8220;equal to&#8221 between the left and right operands.</p>

<p>The <code>rightOperand</code> property values are defined as instances of the RightOperand class, or IRIs, or Literal values. The <code>rightOperand</code> is the value of the Constraint that is to be compared to the <code>leftOperand</code>. The <code>rightOperandReference</code> represents an IRI that MUST be de-referenced first to obtain the actual value of the <code>rightOperand</code>. A <code>rightOperandReference</code> is used in cases where the value of the <code>rightOperand</code> MUST be obtained from dereferencing an IRI first.  Only one of <code>rightOperand</code> or <code>rightOperandReference</code> MUST appear in the Constraint.</p>

 <p>
The <code>rightOperand</code> represents a value and the <code>rightOperandReference</code> represents an IRI that must be de-referenced to obtain the value. If the <code>rightOperand</code> was <code>http://example.com/c100</code> then that is interpreted as the value to be compared in the  expression. If the <code>rightOperandReference</code>  was the same value of <code>http://example.com/c100</code>, then that IRI must be de-referenced first and the data returned must be interpreted as the value to be compared in the expression.
 </p> 
      
<p>The <code>dataType</code> indicates the type of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as <code>xsd:decimal</code> or <code>xsd:datetime</code> and the <code>unit</code> indicates the unit value of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;EU currency&#8221;.</p>

<p>The <code>status</code> provides a value generated from the <code>leftOperand</code> action that MUST be used in the comparison expression. For example, a <code>count</code> constraint could have a <code>rightOperand</code> value of 10, and the <code>status</code> of 5. This means that the action has already been exercised 5 times and the comparison must compare the current action to the status value.</p>


</section>
    
    
<section id="constraint-logical">
<h3>Logical Constraint Class</h3>
 
 <p>   
     A Logical Constraint class is used for expressions which compare two or more operands which are existing Constraints by one logical operator. If the comparison returns a logical match, then the Logical Constraint is <strong>satisfied</strong>, otherwise it is <strong>not satisfied</strong>. For example,  three Constraints could be logically <strong>and</strong>-ed indicating that all three must be true for the Logical Constraint to be satisfied.</p>

      
<p>The Logical Constraint class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Logical Constraint MUST have one <code><em>operand</em></code> sub-property indicating the logical relationship of the compared existing constraints; its value is a list of the existing Constraint instances.</li>
</ul>    
    
<p>An ODRL evaluator MUST support the following sub-properties of <code><em>operand</em></code>:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>or</code> -  at least one of the Constraints MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>xone</code> - only one, and not more, of the  Constraints MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>and</code> - all of the Constraints MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>andSequence</code> - all of the Constraints - in sequence - MUST be satisfied</li>
    </ul>

 <p>Additional <code><em>operand</em></code> sub-properties MAY be defined by ODRL Profiles.</p>
    
<p>The ODRL validation requirements for Logical Constraints includes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The <code><em>operand</em></code> MUST only be of the sub-properties; <code>or</code>, <code>xone</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>andSequence</code>. Additional sub-properties of <code><em>operand</em></code> MAY be defined by ODRL Profiles exclusively for the use of Logical Constraints.</li>
		<li>All of the operand values MUST be unique Constraint instances.</li>
		
    </ol>

	<p>The Constraint instances MUST be evaluated and the outcomes used to determine if the logical relationship is satisfied (based on the semantics of the <code><em>operand</em></code> sub-property).</p>

 

	<p class="note">
	When using a logical operand that needs to be evaluated in sequence, such as <code>andSequence</code>, the serialisations MUST preserve the order of the members of the list. In JSON-LD, the <code>@list</code> keyword MUST be used to represent an ordered collection.

<h3>Refinement property with a Party Collection</h3>
	
	<p>
	  A <code>PartyCollection</code> MAY include a <code>refinement</code> property to indicate the refinement context under which to identify individual Party(ies) of the complete collection. The <code>refinement</code> property applies to the characteristics of each member of the collection (and not the resource as a whole). 
	
		To meet this condition of identifying individual Party(ies) of the complete <code>PartyCollection</code>, all of the Constraints/Logical Constraints referenced by the <code>refinement</code> property MUST be <strong>satisfied</strong>. </p>
	
	 
	<p>Note: The outcome of applying refinements to a PartyCollection SHOULD NOT result in a null set.</p>
	
	<p>Note that when using the <code>refinement</code> property, the <code>uid</code> property MUST NOT be used to <em>identify</em> the <code>PartyCollection</code>. Instead, the <code>source</code> property MUST be used to <em>reference</em> the <code>PartyCollection</code>. </p>
	
       
	
	
    <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The target Asset <code>http://example.com/myPhotos:BdayParty</code> is a set of photos posted to a social network site by the assigner of the photos <code>http://example.com/user44</code>. The assignee source is a PartyCollection <code>http://example.com/user44/friends</code> and represents all the friends of the assigner. 
    The assignee also has a refinement that indicates only members of the collection over the <code>foaf:age</code> of 18 will be assigned the <code>display</code> permission.

<h3>Rule Class</h3>


<p>The Rule class is the parent of the Permission, Prohibition, and Duty classes. The Rule class represents the common characteristics of these three classes.
</p>

<p>The Rule class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Rule MUST have one <code>action</code> property value of type Action.</li>
	<li>A Rule MAY have none or one <code><em>relation</em></code> sub-property values of type Asset.</li>
	<li>A Rule MAY have none, one or many <code><em>function</em></code> sub-property values of type Party.</li>
	<li>A Rule MAY have none, one or many <code><em>failure</em></code> sub-property values of type Rule.</li>
<li>A Rule MAY have none, one or many <code>constraint</code> property values of type Constraint/LogicalConstraint.</li>
<li>A Rule MAY have none or one <code>uid</code> property values (of type IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to identify the Rule so it MAY be referenced by other Rules.</li>
</ul>
	
	<p>Note: The above property cardinalities reflect the normative ODRL Information Model. In some cases, repeat occurrences of some properties are also supported (as described in <a href="#composition">Policy Rule Composition</a> and <a href="#composition-compact">Compact Policy</a>) but the normative atomic Policy is consistent with the above property cardinalities.</p>
	
<p>Explicit sub-properties of the abstract <code><em>relation</em></code>, <code><em>relation</em></code> and <code><em>failure</em></code> properties must be used, the choice depending on the subclass of Rule in question.</p>

	<p>The three classes of Rules also form important relationships with the Duty Rule. The property relationships are summarised in the figure below.</p>

<section id="permission">
<h3>Permission Class</h3>


<p>A Permission <strong>allows</strong> an action to be <strong>exercised</strong> on an Asset if all constraints are <strong>satisfied</strong> and if all duties are <strong>fulfilled</strong>.</p>

<p>The Permission class is a subclass of, and inherits all the properties from, the Rule class - and has the following additional property semantics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Permission MUST have one <code>target</code> property value of type Asset. (Other <code><i>relation</i></code> sub-properties MAY be used.)</li>
    <li>A Permission MAY have none or one <code>assigner</code> and/or <code>assignee</code> property values (of type Party) for functional roles. (Other <code><i>function</i></code> sub-properties  MAY be used.)</li>
    <li>A Permission MAY have none, one, or more <code>duty</code> property values of type Duty.</li>
</ul>
		
	<p>Note: The above property cardinalities reflect the normative ODRL Information Model. In some cases, repeat occurrences of some properties are also supported (as described in <a href="#composition">Policy Rule Composition</a> and <a href="#composition-compact">Compact Policy</a>) but the normative atomic Policy is consistent with the above property cardinalities.</p>
	
	
<p>The duty property expresses an agreed obligation that MUST be fulfilled. That is, the duty property asserts a <em>pre-condition</em> between the Permission and the Duty. See the <a href="#duty-perm">Duty with a Permission</a> section for more details.</p>

    
<blockquote>   
<p>Example Use Case: The Policy <code>Offer</code> from assigner <code>http://example.com/org:xyz</code> expresses the play action for the target Asset <code>http//example.com/game:9090</code> and the permission is valid until the end of the year 2017.</p>

<section id="prohibition">
<h3>Prohibition Class</h3>

<p>A Prohibition <strong>disallows</strong> an action to be <strong>exercised</strong> on an Asset if all constraints are <strong>satisfied</strong>. If the Prohibition has been <strong>infringed</strong> by the action being exercised, then all of the remedies MUST be <strong>fulfilled</strong> to set the state of the Prohibition to <strong>not infringed</strong>.
</p>
    
	<p>The Prohibition class is a subclass of, and inherits all the properties from, the Rule class - and has the following additional property semantics:</p>
<ul>
	 <li>A Prohibition MUST have one <code>target</code> property value of type Asset. (Other <code><i>relation</i></code> sub-properties MAY be used.)</li>
    <li>A Prohibition MAY have none or one <code>assigner</code> and/or <code>assignee</code> property values (of type Party) for functional roles. (Other <code><i>function</i></code> sub-properties MAY be used.)</li>	
    <li>A Prohibition MAY have none, one, or more <code>remedy</code> property values of type Duty.</li>
</ul>
	
		
	<p>Note: The above property cardinalities reflect the normative ODRL Information Model. In some cases, repeat occurrences of some properties are also supported (as described in <a href="#composition">Policy Rule Composition</a> and <a href="#composition-compact">Compact Policy</a>) but the normative atomic Policy is consistent with the above property cardinalities.</p>
	
	
<p>The <code>remedy</code> property (a sub-property of the <code><em>failure</em></code> property) expresses an agreed obligation that MUST be fulfilled in the case that the Prohibition has been <strong>infringed</strong>. That is, the remedy property asserts a Duty that must be fulfilled if the action of the Prohibition is exercised.  See the <a href="#duty-prohib">Remedy with a Prohibition</a> section for more details.</p>
	
 <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The assigner of a target Asset <code>http://example.com/photoAlbum:55</code> expresses an Agreement Policy with both a Permission and a Prohibition. The assigner Party <code>http://example.com/MyPix:55</code> assigns the Permission <code>display</code> to the assignee Party <code>http://example.com/assignee:55</code> at the same time a Prohibition to <code>archive</code> the target Asset. Additionally, in case of any conflicts in the Policy (e.g., between Permissions and Prohibitions), the <code>conflict</code> property of the <code>Policy</code> is set to <code>perm</code> indicating that the Permissions will take precedence.</p>

<section id="duty">
<h3>Duty Class</h3>
	
<p>A Duty is the <strong>obligation</strong> to <strong>exercise</strong> an  action. A Duty is <strong>fulfilled</strong> if all constraints are <strong>satisfied</strong> and if its action has been <strong>exercised</strong>. If its action has not been exercised, then all <code>consequence</code>s must be fulfilled to fulfil the Duty. (Note: only Duties referenced by duty or obligation properties may use consequence properties.)
	</p>
	
	
<p>The Duty class is a subclass of, and inherits all the properties from, the Rule class - and has the following additional property semantics:</p>
<ul>
     <li>A Duty MAY have none or one <code>target</code> property values (of type Asset)  to indicate the Asset that is the primary subject to which the Duty directly applies. (Other <code><i>relation</i></code> sub-properties  MAY be used.)</li>
	  <li>A Duty MAY have none or one <code>assigner</code> and/or <code>assignee</code> property values (of type Party) for functional roles. (Other <code><i>function</i></code> sub-properties MAY be used.)</li> 
	  <li>A Duty MAY have none, one or many <code>consequence</code> property values of type Duty only when the Duty is referenced by a Rule with the duty or obligation properties.</li>
</ul>
	
		
	<p>Note: The above property cardinalities reflect the normative ODRL Information Model. In some cases, repeat occurrences of some properties are also supported (as described in <a href="#composition">Policy Rule Composition</a> and <a href="#composition-compact">Compact Policy</a>) but the normative atomic Policy is consistent with the above property cardinalities.</p>
	
    
	<p>The Duty class also has these additional requirements:</p>
	<ul>
	   <li>The assignee MUST have the ability to exercise the Duty Action.</li>
		<li>The assignee(s) of the Duty MUST satisfy the Duty.</li>
	</ul>
  
<p>The <code>consequence</code> property (a sub-property of the <code><em>failure</em></code> property) is utilised to express the repercussions of not fulfilling an agreed Policy obligation or duty for a Permission. If either of these fails to be fulfilled, then this will result in the consequence Duty <em>also</em> becoming a new requirement, meaning that the original obligation or duty, as well as the consequence Duty MUST all be <strong>fulfilled</strong>. For example, if an obligation to provide data by a certain date is not fulfilled, the a consequence of a $100 fine is payable as well.
</p>

<p>Note that the consequence property MUST NOT be used on a Duty that is already a consequence for a Permission duty or Policy obligation.</p>

<h4>Policy Rule Composition</h4>
             
    <p>The ODRL Information Model provides the normative cardinalities for property relationships to Rules.  At the core level, an ODRL Rule would be related to one Asset, one or more Party functional roles, one Action (and potentially to Constraints and/or Duties)</p>

	<p>The Policy Rules Composition permits each Rule to extend the cardinality requirements of the ODRL Information Model to support a Rule being related to multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions. The purpose is to combine common properties (in a single Rule) to express a more compound Policy. The Policy SHOULD then be processed into its normative <em>atomic</em> equivalent.</p>

<h4>Compact Policy</h4>
	
	
<p>An ODRL Policy MAY hold properties, declared at the Policy-level, which are shared and common to all its Rules. This is aimed only as a <em>short-cut</em> method to support more <strong>compact</strong> serialisations. These shared properties MUST NOT be interpreted as Policy-level properties (such as those defined in the <a href="#policy">Policy Class</a> section).
	
	<p>Properties that MAY be shared (as shown in the figure below) include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>One or many <code>action</code> properties.</li>
	<li>One or many sub-properties of <code>relation</code> (such as <code>target</code>).
 </li>
	<li>One or many sub-properties of <code>function</code> (such as <code>assigner</code> and <code>assignee</code>).</li>
	
	</ul>

    <figcaption>ODRL Shared Properties (Also available in <a href="03Shared.svg">SVG format</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>
	

	<p>The ODRL validation requirements for expanding short-cuts in a Policy is:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>For each Rule in the Policy:</li>
		<ul>
        <li>Verify any relevant shared properties (at the Policy-level).</li>
    <li>Replicate these properties in the Rule.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Remove the shared properties declared at the Policy-level</li>
    </ol>
       
	 <p>Further, follow the ODRL validation requirements to create <em>atomic</em> Rules in the Policy (defined in the previous section).</p> 
	
    <p>It is RECOMMENDED that compact ODRL Policies be expanded to atomic Policies when being processed for conformance.</p>
	
	<p>The example below shows such shared common properties applied to a Policy:</p>
             
<pre id="eg26" class="example hljs json">

<h4>Policy Metadata</h4>
         
       <p>Additional metadata properties MAY be added to a Policy to support further authenticity, and integrity purposes from external vocabularies. The ODRL Information Model recommends the use of Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[dcterms]] for ODRL Policies.</p>
         
         <p>The following Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[dcterms]] properties SHOULD be used:</p>
            <ul>
         <li>none, one, or many <code>dc:creator</code> property values - the individual, agent, or organisation that authored the Policy.</li>
		<li>none, one, or many <code>dc:description</code> property values - a human-readable representation or summary of the Policy.</li>
         <li>none or one <code>dc:issued</code> property values - the date (and time) the Policy was first issued.</li>
         <li>none or one <code>dc:modified</code> property values -  the date (and time) the Policy was updated.</li>
        <li>none, one, or many <code>dc:coverage</code> property values -  the jurisdiction under which the Policy is relevant.</li>
        <li>none or one <code>dc:replaces</code> property values (of type Policy) -  the identifier of a Policy that this Policy supersedes.</li>
        <li>none or one <code>dc:isReplacedBy</code> property values (of type Policy) -  the identifier of a Policy that supersedes this Policy.</li>
         </ul>
         
    <p>The ODRL validation requirements for Policies with the above metadata properties include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If a Policy has the <code>dc:isReplacedBy</code> property, then a processor MUST consider the first Policy void and MUST retrieve and process the identified Policy.</li>
    </ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below example shows metadata properties that indicate who created the Policy, a description, when the Policy was issued, which jurisdiction (an identifier of Queensland, Australia) the Policy applies to, and an identifier of an older version of the Policy it replaces.</p>     </blockquote>

<section id="inheritance">
<h4>Policy Inheritance</h4>

    <p>ODRL supports an inheritance mechanism in which a (child) Policy may inherit all the atomic Rules of one or more (parent) Policies.
       The <code>inheritFrom</code> property MUST be used in a child Policy that is inheriting from a parent Policy and MAY include multiple identifiers of parent Policies.</p>


<p>The following apply when using inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance can be to any depth. (Multiple levels of children Policies.)</li>
<li>Inheritance MUST NOT be circular.</li>
<li>No constraint <code>status</code> information is transferred from the parent Policy to the child Policy. That is, if the parent Policy had <code>status</code> properties with values, then these values would be nulled.</li>
</ul>

    <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: Consider the (parent) Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:default</code> below. It includes a (policy-level) assigner and an Obligation to review the target asset policy document.</p>    
</blockquote>
    
    <pre id="eg29" class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",

        "target": "http://example.com/asset:terms-and-conditions",
        "action": "reviewPolicy"
    }]
}  
</pre>
    
<p>The child <code>Agreement</code>Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:4444</code> below shows the <code>inheritFrom</code> property pointing to the parent Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:default</code> (above). The child Policy shows the target Asset, the actions (to display the Asset) and the assignee Party for the Agreement.</p>    
    
<pre id="eg30" class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",

}  
</pre>
    

<p>After the inheritance is performed - where the parent Policy Rules and Policy-level properties are added to the child Policy - and the Rules are made <em>atomic</em> - the resulting Policy is shown below. The original child Permission rule now includes the (policy-level) assigner from the parent Policy. The parent Obligation rule now appears in the updated child policy with the original child (policy-level) assignee.</p>

<p>The ODRL validation requirements for ODRL Policy Inheritance includes:</p>
    <ol>

        <li>The child Policy MUST access the parent Policy and replicate the following in the updated child Policy:
       <ul>
           <li>All policy-level Assets, Parties, Actions from the parent Policy.</li>
		   <li>All profile identifiers.</li>
		   <li>Any conflict properties</li>
           <li>All Rules from the parent Policy.</li>
       </ul>
            </li>
		<li>Repeat the above for each identified parent Policy.</li>
      <li>The final updated child Policy MAY then be further expanded (into <em>atomic</em> Rules) by following the ODRL validation requirements defined in the <a href="#composition">Policy Composition</a> section.</li>  
		<li>The final child Policy MAY then be evaluated as per the requirements outlined in <a href="#rule-process">Rule Processing</a>.</li>
    </ol>
        
	
</section>
    
<section id="conflict">
<h4>Policy Conflict Strategy</h4>
        
<p>The <code>conflict</code> property is used to establish strategies to resolve conflicts that arise from the merging of Policies or conflicts between Permissions and Prohibitions in the same Policy. Conflicts may arise when merging Policies as a result of <a href="#inheritance">Policy Inheritance</a> and the resultant Rules are inconsistent.</p>
      
    <p>The <code>conflict</code> property SHOULD take one of the following Conflict Strategy Preference values (instance of the ConflictTerm class):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perm</code>: the Permissions MUST override the Prohibitions</li>
<li><code>prohibit</code>: the Prohibitions MUST override the Permissions</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the entire Policy MUST be void if any conflict is detected</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>conflict</code> property is not explicitly set, the default of <code>invalid</code> will be used. <p>Additional <code>conflict</code> property values MAY be defined by ODRL Profiles.</p>



<p>The Conflict Strategy requirements include:</p>
   
<ol>
        <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>perm</code> then any conflicting Permission Rule MUST override the Prohibition Rule.</li>
 <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>prohibit</code> then any conflicting Prohibition Rule MUST override the Permission Rule.</li>
  <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>invalid</code> then   the entire Policy MUST be void.</li> 
 <li>If a Policy has multiple <code>conflict</code> property values (for example, after a Policy merge or inheritance) then the entire Policy MUST be void.</li> 

 </ol>
        
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: Two Policies are associated to the same target Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:1212</code>. The first Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:0001</code> allows to <code>use</code> the Asset. The second Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:0002</code> allows for the display of the Asset, but it prohibits <code>print</code>. Both policies explicitly state how to deal with conflicts through the <code>conflict</code> property being set to <code>perm</code>. Hence the Permissions will always override any Prohibitions. In this use case, since the <code>print</code> Action is a specialisation of the <code>use</code> Action, there could be a conflict. However, the <code>perm</code> conflict strategy means that the <code>use</code> Permission will override the <code>print</code> Prohibition.</p>

<p>In the above use case, if the second Policy had the conflict value of <code>prohibit</code>, then the outcome would be a direct contradiction, and the result will be an void Policy.</p>

<h2>ODRL Profiles</h2>

<section id="profile-motivation">
    <h3>ODRL Profile Purpose</h3>
        
	<p>The ODRL Information Model serves as the core framework and vocabulary to express policies. The ODRL Core Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] articulates this set of vocabulary terms. An ODRL policy may be expressed using the ODRL Core Vocabulary, and this represents the minimally supported policy expression.</p>
	
	<p>An ODRL Profile MUST be defined to provide vocabulary terms (as scoped in the <a href="#profile-mechanism">ODRL Profile Mechanism</a> section) that can be used in ODRL policies requiring additional semantics. An ODRL Profile explicitly serves community needs by specifying the vocabulary terms they require to be supported in ODRL policy expressions. These terms may be defined explicitly or may be adopted from the ODRL Common Vocabulary.</p>
	
	<p>The ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] provides a generic range of common actions for Permissions, Prohibition, and Duties as well as Policy subclasses, Constraint left operands and operators, Asset relations, and Party functions.</p>
        
        
    </section>

	<section id="profile-conformance">
    <h3>ODRL Profile Conformance</h3>
		<p>
    In an ODRL Policy, the <code>profile</code> property MUST be specified to indicate the identifier (IRI) of the ODRL Profile for which the Policy expression conforms to. There MAY be multiple identifiers used to indicate that an ODRL Policy conforms to multiple ODRL Profiles.</p>
		<p>When an ODRL Profile(s) is used in an ODRL Policy, an ODRL Processing system MUST understand the semantics of the identified ODRL Profile(s). If the ODRL Processing system does not recognise the ODRL Profile identifier(s) then it MUST stop processing the policy. </p>

    <section id="profile-mechanism">

<h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The ODRL Information Model does not directly express sensitive personal information such as the identity of the existence of Assets containing such data related to Parties. However, ODRL vocabularies (such as the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] and ODRL Profiles) may define terms that may relate to personal information. These specifications should inform implementations that produce or consume such ODRL expressions to take steps to communicate to all relevant users the manner in which the policy is being used, the identity of any other party with whom that policy is being shared, and the reason the policy is being shared with other parties.

    <b>Features</b>

    <p>
      For the purposes of evaluating exit criteria, the following are considered as features:
    </p>

    <ul>
	<li>A Set/Offer/Agreement Policy type with required properties</li>
	<li>A Policy that utilises an ODRL Profile</li>
	<li>A Policy with an Asset Collection, including parts</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Party Collection, including parts</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Rule including a constraint property</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Permission including a duty property</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Permission including a duty and a consequence property</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Prohibition</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Prohibition including a remedy property</li>
	<li>A Policy with an Obligation</li>
	<li>A Policy with a refinement property on an Action, Asset and Party Collection</li>
	<li>A Policy with a Logical Constraint</li>

The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support innovative expression of  asset usage for the publication, distribution and consumption of content services.
The final outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE).</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
The ODRL Information Model was derived from the ODRL V2.1 Core Model Community Group report. Details of the differences between the W3C Working Group deliverables and the ODRL Community Group Reports are maintained in the <a href="#changes">Appendix</a>. All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>
