<h2>Introduction</h2>   
    
<p>The ODRL Information Model defines the underlying semantic model for permissions and obligations statements describing digital content usage. The information model covers the core concepts, entities and relationships that provide the foundational model for content usage statements.</p>
     
<p>The ODRL Information Model is formally specified using UML notation [[!uml]].</p>

<h2>Relationship to the W3C ODRL Community Group Reports</h2>

    
<p>The basis for the deliverables for the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group are the reports created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a>. The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support innovative expression of digital asset usage for the publication, distribution and consumption of content services.
The final outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE)</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
The ODRL Information Model was derived from the ODRL V2.1 Core Model Community Group report. Details of the differences between the W3C Working Group deliverables and the ODRL Community Group Reports are maintained in the <a href="#community">Appendix</a>. All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>

<h2>Information Model</h2>


<p>The basic context of an ODRL Policy is that only an explicitly permitted use may be executed. Any use not explicitly permitted is prohibited by default. An ODRL Policy only permits the action explicitly specified in a Permission and all other actions are implicitly prohibited. An action defined in a Prohibition should only refine (or directly relate to) the semantics of an action defined in one of the Permissions in the ODRL Policy.</p>
    
<p>For example, an ODRL Policy that has the action &#8220;present&#8221; Permission and may also have the action &#8220;print&#8221; Prohibition (as these actions are related hierarchically in the ODRL Vocabulary).</p>
<p>Note that ODRL Profiles can be developed and used to refine the basic context of an ODRL Policy. Hence, the application of an ODRL Profile must be understood by the consuming community and systems.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Information Model. The <code>Policy</code> is the central entity that holds an ODRL policy together. </p>

<figure>
	<img src="fig/00Model.png" alt="ODRL Information Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Information Model</figcaption>
</figure>

  
    
<p>As the Information Model diagram shows the key <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code> and <code>Duty</code> entities are subtypes of the abstract <code><em>Rule</em></code> class and they have the same relationships to the other key entities (<code>Action</code>, <code>Constraint</code>, <code>Asset</code>, and <code>Party</code>). The core difference is in their semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Permission</code> says that the <code>assignee </code> MAY perform an action,</li>
<li><code>Duty</code> says that the <code>assignee</code> MUST perform an action, and</li>
<li><code>Prohibition</code> says that the <code>assignee</code> MUST NOT perform an action.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code><em>Rule</em></code> class also makes it possible to easily extend the Information Model in Profiles by adding policy expressions (as subclasses of <code><em>Rule</em></code>) that are not possible by default.</p>
    
<p>The cardinalities shown in the ODRL Information Model allow for the greatest flexibility in expressing associations between the key entities. However, <code>Policy Types</code> and <code>Profiles</code> may express narrower and/or specific cardinalities on these entities.</p>

<p>A <code>Permission</code> MAY allow a particular <code>Action</code> to be executed on a related <code>Asset</code>, e.g. &#8220;play the audio file abc.mp3&#8221;. A <code>Constraint</code> like &#8220;at most 10 times&#8221; might be added to specify the <code>Permission</code> more precisely. The <code>Party</code> that grants this <code>Permission</code> is linked to it with the <code>Role</code> <code>assigner</code>, the <code>Party</code> that is granted the <code>Permission</code> is linked to it with the <code>Role</code> <code>assignee</code>, e.g. &#8220;<code>assigner</code> VirtualMusicShop grants the <code>Permission</code> to <code>assignee</code> Alice&#8221;. Additionally, a <code>Permission</code> MAY be linked to <code>Duty</code> entities.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>Permission</code>s, a <code>Duty</code> states that a certain <code>Action</code> MUST be executed by the <code>Party</code> with the <code>Role</code> <code>assignee</code> for the <code>Permission</code> to be valid, e.g. &#8220;Alice must pay 5 EUR in order to get the <code>Permission</code> to play abc.mp3&#8243;.</p>
    
<p>The <code>Prohibition</code> entity is used in the same way as <code>Permission</code>, with the difference that it MUST NOT refer to <code>Duties</code> and that the <code>Action</code> MUST NOT be exercised, e.g. &#8220;Alice is forbidden to use abc.mp3 commercially&#8221;.</p>
    
<p>The following sections describes each entity of the Information Model in greater detail.</p>

<section id="policy">
<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The <code>Policy</code> entity is the top-level entity and contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the <code>Policy</code> entity (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>type</code>: indicates the semantics of the <code>Policy</code> entity (REQUIRED). These are further described in the  Vocabulary and ODRL Profiles.</li>
<li><code>conflict</code>: indicates the precedence between <code>Permission</code>s and <code>Prohibition</code>s (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>undefined</code>: indicates how to handle undefined <code>Action</code>s (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>inheritAllowed</code>: indicates if the <code>Policy</code> entity can be inherited (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>inheritFrom</code>: the identifier from which this <code>Policy</code> inherits from it&#8217;s parent <code>Policy</code> (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>inheritRelation</code>: the identifier for the relationship type of this inheritance structure (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>profile</code>: the identifier of the ODRL Profile that this <code>Policy</code> conforms to (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>uid</code> attribute MUST be a unique identifier.</p>
<p>The range of values for the <code>Policy</code> entity&#8217;s <code>type</code> attribute will be described in the ODRL Vocabulary document or in community profiles. This value MAY also impose further constraints on the Information Model, such as are exemplified in the Scenarios for types <code>Offer</code> and <code>Agreement</code>. It is important that the <code>type</code> attribute be clearly understood in policy expressions as the semantics MAY impose restrictions on the expression language constructs such as cardinalities between entities.</p>
    
<p>The <code>conflict</code> attribute is used either to resolve conflicts arising from the merging of policies, specifically when there are conflicting <code>Action</code>s in the <code>Permission</code>s and <code>Prohibition</code>s, or to set priorities over the <code>Permission</code>s/<code>Prohibition</code>s in the same policy. If present, the <code>conflict</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perm</code>: the <code>Permission</code>s will always takes precedence</li>
<li><code>prohibit</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code>s will always takes precedence</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the policy is not valid</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>conflict</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value will be used instead. The default value of the <code>conflict</code> attribute is <code>invalid</code>.</p>
    
      <div class="issue" data-number="21">
          <p>Need to clarify conflicting values of the conflict attribute. That is, one policy says <code>perm</code> and the other <code>prohibit</code>. </p>
    </div>
    
    
<p>The <code>undefined</code> attribute is used to indicate how to support <code>Action</code>s that are not part of any profile in the policy expression system. If present, the <code>undefined</code> attribute MUST take one of<br />
the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>support</code>: the <code>Action</code> is to be supported as part of the policy &#8211; and the policy remains valid</li>
<li><code>ignore</code>: the <code>Action</code> is to be ignored and not part of the policy &#8211; and the policy remains valid</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the <code>Action</code> is unknown &#8211; and the policy is invalid</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <code>support</code> case, even though the <code>Action</code> is unknown, the policy still is valid and the consuming parties or system of the policy MUST be made aware of the unknown <code>Action</code>. This MAY be via a user interface that displays the unknown <code>Action</code> for human readability.</p>
<p>In the <code>ignore</code> case, even though the <code>Action</code> is unknown, the policy still is valid and the consuming parties or system of the policy MAY be made aware of the unknown <code>Action</code>.</p>
<p>In the <code>invalid</code> case with the unknown <code>Action</code>, the policy is invalid and the consuming parties or system of the policy MUST be made aware of this.</p>
<p>If the <code>undefined</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value will be used instead. The default value of the <code>undefined</code> attribute is <code>invalid</code>.</p>
<p>Other attributes MAY be added to the <code>Policy</code> entity to support additional functions and requirements. Typically, these will be from different community vocabularies. For example, to indicate the issued date or valid dates of the <code>Policy</code> entity, use of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" rel="external nofollow">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> would be recommended.</p>

<section id="inhertiance">
<h4>Inheritance</h4>

    <div class="issue" data-number="22">
        <p>We need to make clear exactly what gets inherited and what gets overriden (if anything)</p>
    </div>
    
    
<p>The <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute in the <code>Policy</code> entity is used to indicate if the <code>Policy</code> expression can be used in any inheritance relationship. If present, the value of the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code>: the <code>Policy</code> expression can be used for inheritance</li>
<li><code>false</code>: the <code>Policy</code> expression can not be used for inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value will be used instead. The default value of the <code>inherit</code> attribute is <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Only if the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute has the value <code>true</code> can the <code>inheritFrom</code> and <code>inheritRelation</code> attributes be specified.</p>
<p>The <code>inheritFrom</code> attribute in the (child) <code>Policy</code> will uniquely identify (via a UID) the (parent) <code>Policy</code> from which the inheritance will be performed.</p>
<p>The <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute in the (child) <code>Policy</code> will uniquely identify (via a UID) the type of inheritance from the (parent) <code>Policy</code>. For example, this may indicate the business scenario, such as <em>subscription</em>, or prior arrangements between the parties (that are not machine representable). Such terms MAY be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary or Community Profiles. For example, an Assigner and Assignee may have a historical arrangement related to the specific use of content they make available to each other. The business model (identified with a URI) is used in the <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute in their subsequent ODRL policies they exchange. This will require the ODRL policy to be interpreted with the additional information identified by the URI. For example, this may include additional permission actions or constraints (etc) that is documented in their business model arrangement.</p>
<p>Both the <code>inheritFrom</code> and <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute MAY be used independently.</p>
<p>The following restrictions apply when using inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single inheritance is only supported. (One Parent <code>Policy</code> to one or more Child <code>Policy</code> entities. No Child <code>Policy</code> can inherit from two or more Parent <code>Policy</code> entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance can be to any depth. (Multiple levels of Children <code>Policy</code> entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance cannot be circular.</li>
<li>The Child <code>Policy</code> MUST override the Parent <code>Policy</code>. i.e.: If the same <code>Action</code> appears in the Parent, then it is replaced by the Child version, otherwise the Parent <code>Action</code>s are added to the Child&#8217;s <code>Action</code>s.</li>
<li>No state information is transferred from the policy in the Parent <code>Policy</code> to the Child <code>Policy</code></li>
</ul>
</section>


<section id="profile">
<h4>Profile</h4>

<p>
The <code>profile</code> attribute in the <code>Policy</code> entity is used to indicate the identifier (URI) of the ODRL Profile for which the policy expression conforms to. This attribute is OPTIONAL, but if the attribute appears, then any consuming system MUST understand the identified ODRL Profile &#8211; and all the rules from the Profile MUST apply to the policy expression. If multiple ODRL Profiles are required, then it is recommended that a new identifier be created to identify the combination of Profiles (and document the combined Profiles).</p>
<p>
Since the ODRL Vocabulary represents broad needs for policy expressibility, different communities will require less or more concepts from the Information Model and terms from the ODRL Vocabulary. Community profiles of the ODRL model are expected to be developed that adequately document these requirements in respect to the Information Model and Vocabulary. Some requirements for communities developing ODRL Profiles include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Document any additions to the Information Model</li>
<li>Document any aspects of the Information Model that will have different default values or interpretations</li>
<li>Document which aspects of the Information Model are not being used (deprecated)</li>
<li>Document new Vocabulary terms</li>
<li>Document deprecated Vocabulary terms</li>
<li>Declare the ODRL Profile identifier (URI)</li>
<li>Declare your communities namespace URI (see the various Encoding specifications)</li>
<li>Share the Community ODRL Profile with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a> for feedback and comments</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that the ODRL Profile URI be the same as the Namespace URI, but this is not mandatory.</p>
</section>
</section>

<section id="asset">
<h3>Asset</h3>
<p>The <code>Asset</code> entity is the subject of an ODRL policy expression that permissions and prohibitions are applied to. The Asset entity can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, or services. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> entities that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with the <code>Duty</code> entity. The <code>Asset</code> entity is referred to by the <code>Permission</code> and/or <code>Prohibition</code> entities, and also by the <code>Duty</code> entity.</p>
<p>The <code>Asset</code> entity contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the <code>Asset</code> (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The identification of the <code>Asset</code> entity is a key foundation of the ODRL Policy language. However, there are some use cases where the ODRL Policy expression MAY be embedded inside the target <code>Asset</code>. In these cases, it MAY be more appropriate to provide, or infer, a link to the <code>Asset</code> entity (as the complete <code>Asset</code> <code>uid</code> may not be known at the time) through the local context. Use of such inference and context MUST be documented in the relevant ODRL community Profile.</p>
<p>Since ODRL policies could deal with any kind of asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe <code>Asset</code> entities of particular media types. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" rel="external nofollow">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> that are appropriate to the <code>Asset</code> type or purpose.</p>
<p>The <code>Relation</code> entity is used to associate the <code>Asset</code> entity with the relevant <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, and <code>Duty</code> entities</p>


<section id="relation">
<h4>Relation</h4>

<p>The <code>Relation</code> entity is an association class and can be used to link to an <code>Asset</code> from either <code>Permission</code>, <code>Duty</code> or <code>Prohibition</code>, indicating how the <code>Asset</code> MAY be utilised in respect to the entity that links to it.</p>
<p>The <code>Relation</code> entity contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>relation</code>: indicates the relationship of the <code>Asset</code> to the linked entity (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value for the <code>relation</code> attribute is <code>target</code> which indicates that the <code>Asset</code> is the primary object to which the <code>Permission</code>, <code>Duty</code> or <code>Prohibition</code> actions apply.</p>
     <div class="note">
          <p>Target is formally defined in the ODRL Vocabulary </p>
    </div>
<p>Other values for the <code>Relation</code> entity MAY be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary and community Profiles.</p>
</section>
</section>


<section id="party">
<h3>Party</h3>
    
<p>The <code>Party</code> entity is the object of an ODRL policy and can be any form of identifiable entity. The <code>Party</code> performs (or does not perform) actions or has a function in a Duty (i.e., assigns the <code>Party</code> to the <code>Rule</code> by associating it with the role it plays in the <code>Rule</code>). The <code>Party</code> entity can be any form of identifiable entity, such as a person, group of people, organisation, or agent. An agent is a person or thing that takes an active role or produces a specified effect.</p>
<p>The <code>Party</code> entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the party (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>function</code>: defines the roles which may be fulfilled by a party in relation to a Rule (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>scope</code>: defines how the role shall be interpreted under different contexts. (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata for the <code>Party</code> element. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as [[vcard-rdf]] or [[foaf]], that are appropriate to the <code>Party</code> type or purpose.</p>
<p>The <code>Role</code> entity is used to associate the <code>Party</code> entity with the relevant <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, and <code>Duty</code> entities.</p>

<section id="role">
<h4> Role</h4>
<p>The <code>Role</code> entity is an association class and can be used to link to a <code>Party</code> from either <code>Permission</code>, <code>Duty</code> or <code>Prohibition</code>, indicating which role the <code>Party</code> takes with respect to the entity that links to it.</p>
<p>The <code>Role</code> entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>function</code>: the functional role the <code>Party</code> takes (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>function</code> attribute MUST support the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assigner</code>: indicates that the <code>Party</code> has assigned the associated <code>Permission</code>, <code>Duty</code>, or <code>Prohibition</code>. In other words, the <code>Party</code> grants a <code>Permission</code> or requires a <code>Duty</code> to be performed or states a <code>Prohibition</code>.</li>
<li><code>assignee</code>: indicates that the <code>Party</code> has been assigned the associated entity, i.e. they are granted a <code>Permission</code> or required to perform a <code>Duty</code> or have to adhere to a <code>Prohibition</code>.</li>
</ul>
    <div class="note">
          <p>Assignee and Asignee are formally defined in the ODRL Vocabulary </p>
    </div>
<p>Other values for the <code>function</code> attribute MAY be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary and community Profiles.</p>
<p>The <code>scope</code> attribute MAY be used to indicate the context under which to interpret the <code>Party</code> entity. If present, the <code>scope</code> attribute MAY take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>individual</code>: indicates that the <code>Party</code> entity is a single individual. The linked <code>Permission</code>, <code>Duty</code> or <code>Prohibition</code> is applicable for that individual only.</li>
<li><code>group</code>: indicates that the <code>Party</code> entity represents a group. The group consisting of many individual members. The linked <code>Permission</code>, <code>Duty</code> or <code>Prohibition</code> is applicable for each member of that group. For example, a (constrained) <code>Permission</code> to play a movie 5 times is valid for each <code>Party</code> member or the <code>Duty</code> to pay 3 EUR has to be fulfilled by each <code>Party</code> member.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other values for the <code>scope</code> attribute MAY be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary and community Profiles.</p>
</section>

</section>

<section id="permission">
<h3>Permission</h3>


<p>The <code>Permission</code> entity indicates the <code>Action</code>s that the <code>assignee</code> is permitted to perform on the associated <code>Asset</code>. In other words, what the <code>assigner</code> (supplier) has granted to the <code>assignee</code> (consumer).</p>
<p>An ODRL policy expression MAY contain at least one <code>Permission</code>. It is important to verify the semantics of the <code>Policy</code> <code>type</code> attribute as this MAY indicate additional constraints on the Policy expression structure.</p>
<p>If several <code>Permission</code> entities are referred to by a <code>Policy</code>, then <em>all of them</em> are valid.</p>
<p>The <code>Permission</code> entity has the following relations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Asset</code>: the <code>Permission</code> entity MUST refer to an <code>Asset</code> (where at least one, and only one, <code>relation</code> value is <code>target</code>) on which the linked <code>Action</code> MAY be performed (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>Action</code>: the <code>Permission</code> entity MUST refer to <em>exactly one</em> <code>Action</code> that indicates the granted operation on the target <code>Asset</code> (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>Party</code>: the <code>Permission</code> MUST refer to one or more <code>Party</code> entities linked via the <code>Role</code> entity (see Section 2.3.1) (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Constraint</code>: the <code>Permission</code> MAY refer to one or more <code>Constraint</code>s which affect the validity of the <code>Permission</code>, e.g. if the <code>Action</code> <code>play</code> is only permitted for a certain period of time (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Duty</code>: the <code>Permission</code> MAY refer to one or more <code>Duty</code> entities that indicate a requirement that MAY be fulfilled in return for receiving the <code>Permission</code> (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="duty">
<h3>Duty</h3>

<p>The <code>Duty</code> entity indicates a requirement that MUST be fulfilled in return for being entitled to the referring <code>Permission</code> entity. A <code>Duty</code> MUST only be associated with a <code>Permission</code>. </p>
<p>While implying different semantics, the <code>Duty</code> entity is similar to <code>Permission</code> in that it is an Action that can be undertaken. If a <code>Permission</code> refers to several <code>Duty</code> entities, <em>all of them</em> MUST be fulfilled for the <code>Permission</code> to become valid. If several <code>Permission</code> entities refer to one <code>Duty</code>, then the Duty only has to be fulfilled <em>once</em> for all the <code>Permission</code> entities to become valid.</p>
<p>The <code>Duty</code> entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: a unique identification for this <code>Duty</code>. Used to refer a single <code>Duty</code> to multiple <code>Permission</code> entities (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Duty</code> entity has the following relations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Action</code>: indicates the operation that MUST be performed (REQUIRED). Note: It is assumed that the assigned Party has the appropriate permissions to perform this action.</li>
<li><code>Party</code>: a <code>Duty</code> MAY refer to <code>Party</code> entities with different <code>Role</code>s. If no explicit <code>Party</code> is linked to as <code>assignee</code> or <code>assigner</code>, the <code>Parties</code> with the respective <code>Role</code>s are taken from the referring <code>Permission</code>. (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Asset</code>: a <code>Duty</code> entity MAY refer to an <code>Asset</code> (where at least one, and only one, <code>relation</code> value is <code>target</code>) related to fulfilling the <code>Duty</code>. (OPTIONAL) For example, a <code>nextPolicy</code> <code>Action</code> must be linked to the identifier of a target policy <code>Asset</code>.</li>
<li><code>Constraint</code>: a <code>Duty</code> MAY link to one or more <code>Constraint</code>s (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>

<p>A <code>Duty</code> entity does not by default specify any conditions on <em>when</em> the <code>Duty</code> <code>Action</code> MUST be performed in order for the <code>Permission</code> to be exercised. Such temporal conditions MAY be expressed through additional <code>Constraint</code>s.</p>
    
<p>For example, to support cases where the <code>Duty</code> MUST be performed for each <code>Action</code> on an <code>Asset</code> before it is exercised (for example, a <em>pay-per-view</em> scenario) then the use of a <code>Constraint</code> (e.g. count=1) on the <code>Permission</code> (e.g. play) and a temporal (or event) <code>Constraint</code> on the <code>Duty</code> can express this semantics.</p>
</section>

<section id="prohibition">
<h3>Prohibition</h3>

<p>The <code>Prohibition</code> entity indicates the <code>Action</code>s that the <code>assignee</code> is prohibited to perform on the related <code>Asset</code>. <code>Prohibition</code>s are issued by the supplier of the <code>Asset</code> &#8211; the <code>Party</code> with the <code>Role</code> <code>assigner</code>. If several <code>Prohibition</code> entities are referred to by a <code>Policy</code>, <em>all of them</em> must be satisfied.</p>
<p>The <code>Prohibition</code> entity has the following relations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Asset</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code> entity MUST refer to an <code>Asset</code> (where at least one, and only one, <code>relation</code> value is <code>target</code>) on which the <code>Action</code> is prohibited (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>Action</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code> entity MUST refer to <em>exactly one</em> <code>Action</code> that is prohibited (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>Party</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code> MAY refer to one or more <code>Party</code> entities linked via the <code>Role</code> entity (see Section 2.3.1) (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Constraint</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code> MAY refer to one or more <code>Constraint</code> entities (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section id="action">
<h3>Action</h3>


<p>The <code>Action</code> entity (when related to a <code>Permission</code> entity) indicates the operations (e.g. <code>play</code>, <code>copy</code>, etc.) that the <code>assignee</code> (i.e. the consumer) is <em>permitted</em> to perform on the related <code>Asset</code> linked to by <code>Permission</code>. When related to a <code>Prohibition</code>, the <code>Action</code> entity indicates the operations that the <code>assignee</code> (again the consumer) is <em>prohibited</em> to perform on the <code>Asset</code> linked to by <code>Prohibition</code>. Analogously, when related to a <code>Duty</code>, it indicates the operation to be performed.</p>
<p><code>Action</code> contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: indicates the <code>Action</code> entity term (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>As its value, the <code>name</code> attribute MAY take one of a set of <code>Action</code> <em>names</em> which are formally defined in profiles. The ODRL Vocabulary defines a standard set of potential terms that MAY be used. Communities will develop new (or extend existing) profiles to capture additional and refined semantics.</p>
</section>

<section id="constraint">
<h3>Constraint</h3>

<p>The <code>Constraint</code> entity indicates limits and restrictions to the <code>Permission</code>, the <code>Prohibition</code> and the <code>Duty</code> entity. <code>Constraint</code>s express mathematical terms with two operands and one operator. For example, the &#8220;number of usages&#8221; (<code>name</code>) must be &#8220;smaller than&#8221; (<code>operator</code>) the &#8220;number 10&#8221; (<code>rightOperand</code>).</p>
<p>If multiple <code>Constraint</code> entities are linked to the same <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, or <code>Duty</code> entity, then all of the <code>Constraint</code> entities MUST be satisfied. That is, all the <code>Constraint</code> entities are (boolean) <em>and</em>ed. In the case where the same <code>Constraint</code> is repeated, then these MUST be represented as a single <code>Constraint</code> entity using an appropriate <code>operator</code> value (for example, <code>isAnyOf</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>Constraint</code> entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: a name that identifies the left operand of the operation (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>operator</code>: an operator function (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>rightOperand</code>: the right operand of the operation (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>dataType</code>: the datatype of the rightOperand (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>unit</code>: the units of the rightOperand (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>status</code>: the current value of the left operand (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>name</code> identifies the left operand of the mathematical operation for the <code>Constraint</code> such as &#8220;Number of Usages&#8221; and &#8220;Expiration Date&#8221; etc. The <code>operator</code> identifies the comparative operation such as &#8220;greater than&#8221; or &#8220;equal to&#8221;. The <code>rightOperand</code> identifies the value that is being compared. The <code>dataType</code> indicates the type of the <code>rightOperand</code>, such as &#8220;decimal&#8221; or &#8220;datetime&#8221; and the <code>unit</code> indicates the unit value of the <code>rightOperand</code>, such as &#8220;EU dollars&#8221;.</p>
<p>When processing policy expressions, these <code>Constraint</code> names MAY be directly linked to a procedure that can determine the outcome of the operations, such as the number of already performed usages and the current date. The <code>name</code> and <code>operator</code> are defined in the ODRL  Vocabulary or community profiles.</p>
<p>The <code>status</code> provides the current value of the <code>Constraint</code> variable (i.e. current value of <code>name</code>). This is useful in cases where the current status of <code>Constraint</code>s needs to be captured and expressed in the ODRL Information Model.</p>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<p>This section shows a number of policy expression scenarios. In these examples, the different policy expression <code>type</code>s that are used are for illustrative purposes only and are not part of this normative specification. Also, the specific <code>Action</code> and <code>Constraint</code> names (etc.) used in these examples are for illustrative purposes only. Please note that formal policy expression <code>type</code>s and other entities are defined in the ODRL  Vocabulary specification, or in community profiles.</p>

<h2>Experimental Features</h2> 
        
     <div class="note">
        <p>Should this section be included in a W3C REC?</p>
    </div>
    
 <p>This section contains advanced ODRL features. Although not part of the normative specification, they provide an opportunity for communities to experiment with and provide feedback on experiences that may be included in future ODRL versions.</p>

<section id="extended-relations">
<h3>Extended Relations</h3>
<p><code>Extended Relations</code> may tie <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, <code>Duty</code>, and <code>Constraint</code> entities together with an <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code> or <code>XOR</code> relationship. Only entities of the same type can be linked with this model. For example, a <code>Permission</code> and <code>Prohibition</code> cannot be linked together within this model. The Extended Relations model supports the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>operation</code>: may be set with <em>one</em> of the mathematical values <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code> and <code>XOR</code>. (<code>OR</code> is the default if not specified.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table outlines the semantics of Extended Relations with respect to each of the main entity types.</p>

<table class="simple">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>Permission</code></td>
<td><code>Prohibition</code></td>
<td><code>Duty</code></td>
<td><code>Constraint</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>OR</code></td>
<td>The related party may perform <em>any</em> (<em>at least</em>) one of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MAY NOT perform <em>at least</em> one of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MUST perform <em>at least</em> one of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related <code>Permission</code>/<code>Prohibition</code>/<code>Duty</code> is restricted by <em>at least</em> one of the <code>Constraint</code>s</td>
</tr>
    
<tr>
<td><code>AND</code></td>
<td>The related party MUST perform <em>all</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MAY NOT perform <em>all</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MUST perform <em>all</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related <code>Permission</code>/<code>Prohibition</code>/<code>Duty</code> is restricted by <em>all</em> of the <code>Constraint</code>s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>XOR</code></td>
<td>The related party MAY perform only <em>one</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MAY NOT perform only <em>one</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MUST perform only <em>one</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related <code>Permission</code>/<code>Prohibition</code>/<code>Duty</code> is restricted by only <em>one</em> of the <code>Constraint</code>s.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that Extended Relations are not needed to assign two or more <code>Permission</code>s to a <code>Party</code> entity. In this case simply use as many <code>Assignee</code> relations between <code>Party</code> and <code>Permission</code> as needed.</p>
    
</section>
    
<section id="remedies">
<h3>Remedies</h3>
    <div class="note">
            <p>This section will be removed from the next release.</p>
    </div>
<p>In the ODRL Information Model, <code>Duties</code> are only directly related to <code>Permission</code>s, meaning that for a <code>Permission</code> to become effective, the related <code>Duty</code> should be performed. For some use cases though, it might be useful to attach a <code>Duty</code> to a <code>Prohibition</code>, meaning that if a <code>Prohibition</code> is violated, the <code>Duty</code> has to be performed as a kind of remedy or consequence for the violation.</p>
<p>Not only can a <code>Prohibition</code> have a <code>Duty</code> attached to it as a remedy, even <code>Duties</code> themselves may have remedies, e.g. &#8220;For the <code>Permission</code> to play audio file xyz to become effective, you have to perform the <code>Duty</code> &#8216;pay 2€&#8217;. If you don&#8217;t perform this <code>Duty</code> (even though you&#8217;ve played yxz), you have to remedy this by performing the <code>Duty</code> &#8216;pay 5€'&#8221;.</p>
<p>In order to distinguish between a <code>Duty</code> that has to be fulfilled as a requirement and one that has to be fulfilled as a remedy, different relation names are introduced as shown in the Figure below.</p>

 <figure>
	<img src="fig/exp-remedy.png" alt="Remedy Model" width="600"/>
    <figcaption>Remedy Model</figcaption>
</figure>
    
<p>The relation between <code>Permission</code> and <code>Duty</code>, which was unnamed before, is now named <code>hasRequirement</code>. This is needed not only to make the different semantics clearer, but also because a <code>Duty</code> can refer to yet another <code>Duty</code> as a requirement, e.g. &#8220;If you want to print this written article, you have the <code>Duty</code> to attach a particular image of the author, and if you do that, you have the <code>Duty</code> to attribute the image to the photographer&#8221;.</p>
