    <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for describing statements about content usage. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL statements. </p>
        <p>Policies are used to explicitly state what are the permitted and prohibited actions over a certain resource. In addition, policies may be integrated with complex constraints (e.g., time constraints) which apply to such actions to impose further restrictions to the uses of the resource. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>   

<p>Several business scenarios require to express what are the permitted and prohibited actions over  content. These permitted/prohibited actions are usually expressed under the form of policies, i.e., entities that allow to indicate those uses and re-uses of the content which are conformant with the existing regulations or to the constraints assigned by the owner. Policies may also be enriched with additional information, i.e., who are the entities in charge of the definition of such Policy and those who are required to conform to it, what are the additional constrains to be associated with the Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties expressed by the Policy. The ability to express these concepts and relationships is important both for the producers of content, i.e., they may state in a clear way what are the permitted and the prohibited actions to prevent misuses, and for the consumers, i.e., they may know precisely how they are allowed to use and re-use the content to avoid breaking the law or the owner's constraints. This specification describes a common approach to expressing these concepts, and more.</p>
<p>The ODRL Information Model defines the underlying semantic model for permission and obligation statements describing content usage. The information model covers the core concepts, entities and relationships that provide the foundational model for content usage statements. These machine-readable policies may be linked directly with the content they are associated to with the aim to allow consumers to easily retrieve those information.</p>
     
<section id="aimsModel">
<h3>Aims of the Model</h3>

<p>The primary aim of the ODRL Information Model is to provide a standard description model and format to express permission and obligation statements to be associated to content in general. These permission and obligation statements are employed to describe the terms of use and reuse of  resources. The model should cover as many Permission and Obligation use cases as possible, while keeping the policy modeling easy even when dealing with complex uses.</p>

<p>The ODRL Information Model is a single, consistent model that can be used by all interested parties. All efforts have been made to keep the implementation costs for both content producers and consumers to a minimum. A single method of fulfilling a use case is strongly preferred over multiple methods, unless there are existing standards that need to be accommodated or there is a significant cost associated with using only a single method. While the Information Model is built using Linked Data principles, the design is intended to allow non-graph-based implementations also. </p>

<h2>ODRL Information Model</h2>

<p>The ODRL Information Model represents Policies that express Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties related to the usage of Assets. The Information Model explicitly expresses what is allowed and what is not allowed by the Policy, as well as other terms, requirements, and parties involved. The aim of the ODRL Information Model is to enable flexible Policy expressions by allowing the policy author to include as much, or as little, detail in the Policies.</p>

<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Information Model.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="00Model.svg" alt="ODRL Information Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Information Model (Also available in <a href="00Model.png">PNG format</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

  
    
<p>The ODRL Information Model has the following classes:
    <ul>
        <li><code>Policy</code> - A non-empty group of Permissions (via the permission property) and/or Prohibitions (via the prohibition property). The Policy class is the parent class to the Set, Offer, and Agreement subclasses:</li>
        <ul>
        <li><code>Set</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports expressing generic Rules.</li>
        <li><code>Offer</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports offerings of Rules from assigner Parties.</li>
        <li><code>Agreement</code> - a subclass of Policy that supports granting of Rules from assigner to assignee Parties. </li>
        </ul>
    <li><code>Asset</code> - A resource or a collection of resources that are the subject of a Rule (via the abstract <em>relation</em> property). The Asset class is the parent class to:</li>
         <ul>
        <li><code>AssetCollection</code> - a subclass of Asset that identifies a collection of resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><code>Party</code> - An entity or a collection of entities that undertake Roles in a Rule (via the abstract <em>function</em> property). The Party class is the parent class to:</li>
         <ul>
        <li><code>PartyCollection</code> - a subclass of Party that identifies a collection of entities.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><code>Action</code> - An operation on an Asset.</li>
    <li><code>Rule</code> - An abstract concept that represents the common characteristics of Permissions, Prohibitions, and Duties.</li>
        <ul>
    <li><code>Permission</code> - The ability to perform an Action over an Asset. The Permission MAY also have the <strong>duty</strong> property that expresses an agreed Action that MUST be performed (as a requirement to be granted the Permission).</li>
    <li><code>Prohibition</code> - The inability to perform an Action over an Asset.</li>
    <li><code>Duty</code> - The obligation to perform an Action. The Action has been agreed to be performed as a requirement for the applicable Permission to become valid.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><code>Constraint</code> - A Boolean expression that refines the applicability of a Rule, or the context of a Party or Asset collection.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The ODRL Information Model hass two abstract properties between Rule and the Asset and Party class. These two properties (<em>relation</em> and <em>function</em>) are designed to represent the <em>conceptual</em> relation between the two classes. In serialised ODRL expressions, they MUST be realised as subtypes of their respective parent property.   The figure below shows the ODRL Properties Model with subtypes.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="01Properties.svg" alt="ODRL Properties Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Properties Model (Also available in <a href="01Properties.png">PNG format</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The figure shows the <em>relation</em> property with subtype <strong>target</strong> to express that the Asset is the primary subject of the Rule. The <em>function</em> property has subtype <strong>assigner</strong> to express the Party issuing the Rule, and subtype <strong>assignee</strong> to express the recipient Party of the Rule. 
</p> 
    
    
<div class="note">
<p>The ODRL Information Model provides a <em>logical view</em> of the components of the Policy model. The <em>implementable view</em> of the ODRL Information Model is provided by various encoding serialisations as normatively described in the ODRL Vocabulary &amp; Expression document [[odrl-vocab]]. The mapping of the logical Information Model components to the implementable serialisations may require some trade-offs and/or differences depending on the features supported by the serialisation language.</p>
</div>
    
<p>The following sections provide further details on the ODRL Information Model. </p>

<section id="policy">
<h3>Policy Class</h3>

<p>The Policy class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Policy MUST have one <code>uid</code> property to identify (via a IRI [[!rfc3987]]) of the Policy.</li>
<li>A Policy MUST have one and MAY have many<code>permission</code> or <code>prohibition</code> properties for Rules.  (See the <a href="#permission">Permission</a> and  <a href="#prohibition">Prohibition</a> sections for more details.)</li>  
<li>A Policy MAY have none or one <code>conflict</code> property for Conflict Strategy Preferences indicating how to handle Policy conflicts.(See the <a href="#conflict">Policy Conflict Strategy</a> section for more details.)</li>
<li>A Policy MAY have none or one <code>inheritAllowed</code> property (a boolean) indicating a Policy can be inherited by other Policies. (See the <a href="#inhertiance">Policy Inheritance</a> section for more details.)</li>
<li>A Policy MAY have none or one <code>profile</code> property to identify (via a IRI [[!rfc3987]]) the ODRL Profile that this Policy conforms to. (See the <a href="#profile">ODRL Profiles</a> section for more details.)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Policy class MAY also include other direct properties to support <a href="#composition-compact">Compact Policy</a> serialisations and references to common <a href="#constraint">Constraints</a>. These are not to be considered as direct properties of the Policy but as an intermediate step, that after applying <a href="#composition">atomic processing rules</a> will create a Policy  consistent with the normative ODRL Informantion Model.
	</p>
	
<p>An ODRL Policy MAY be subclassed to more precisely describe the <em>context</em> of use of the 
	Policy that MAY include additional constraints that ODRL processors MUST understand. The Policy subclasses SHOULD be documented in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] or in ODRL Profiles. 
    
<section id="policy-set">
<h3>Set Class</h3> 

    <p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Set</code> represents any combination of Rules. The <code>Set</code> Policy subclass is also the default subclass of Policy (if none is specified).</p>

     <p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Set</code>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MUST have one and MAY have many relationships to a Rule.</li>

<section id="policy-offer">
<h3>Offer Class</h3> 

<p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Offer</code> represents Rules that are being offered from assigner Parties. An <code>Offer</code> is typically used to make available Policies to a wider audience, but does not grant any Rules.</p>
    
    <p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Offer</code>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>MUST have one and MAY have many relationships to a Permission or Prohibition.</li>

<section id="policy-agreement">
<h3>Agreement Class</h3> 

<p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Agreement</code> represents Rules that have been granted from assigner to assignee Parties. An <code>Agreement</code> is typically used to grant the terms of the Rules between the Parties.</p>
    
    <p>An ODRL Policy of subclass <code>Agreement</code>:</p>

<section id="asset">
<h3>Asset Class</h3>
<p>An Asset class is a resource or a collection of resources that are the subject of a Rule. The Asset can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, or services. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> classes that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with a Duty. An Asset is referred to by the Permission and/or Prohibition, and also by the Duty.</p>
 
<p>The Asset class has the following subclass:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li><code>AssetCollection</code> - an Asset that is a collection of resources. This indicates that all the items in the collection will be the subject of the Rule.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>The Asset class has the following properties:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>An Asset SHOULD have one <code>uid</code> property to identify the Asset using an IRI [[!rfc3987]].</li>
	
	<li>An Asset MUST have one and MAY have many <code><em>relation</em></code> sub-properties for Asset indicating the link to the Asset.</li>
	
    <li>An Asset MAY have none, one, or many <code>partOf</code> properties to identify (IRI [[!rfc3987]]) an AssetCollection that this Asset is in a collection of.</li>
<li>An AssetCollection MAY have none, one, or many <code>constraint</code> properties for Constraint. See <a href="#constraint-asset">Asset Constraints</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
    
    <p class="note">If an Asset does not assert an identifier using the <code>uid</code> property, then the full implications must be understood, such as the impact on ODRL Validators and Evaluators of ODRL Policies.</p>
    
<p>Since ODRL Policies could deal with any kind of Asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe Assets of particular media types. It is recommended to use  existing metadata standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> that are appropriate to the Asset type or purpose.</p>

<section id="relation">
<h4>Relation Property</h4>

<p>The abstract <code><em>relation</em></code> property is used to create an explicit link between an Action and an Asset, indicating how the Asset MUST be utilised in respect to the Rule that links to it. Two sub-properties of the <code><em>relation</em></code> property are used to define the nature of that link, namely <code><em>target</em></code> and <code><em>output</em></code>.</p>

    <p>An ODRL validator MUST support the following sub-properties of <code><em>relation</em></code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>target</code>: indicates that the Asset is the primary subject to which the Rule action directly applies.</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>Other <code><em>relation</em></code> subtype properties SHOULD be defined in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>
    
        
 <blockquote>   
<p>Example Use Case: The assigner Party <code>http//example.com/party:0001</code> offers to display the <code>target</code> Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:3333</code>.</p>

    }]
}
</pre>

<div class="note">
    <p>In the above example, the JSON-LD representation for the <code><em>relation</em></code> property directly uses <code>target</code> as the token, as this has been defined as a subtype of the parent <code><em>relation</em></code> property.</p>

<blockquote>	
    <p>Example Use Case: The below Policy shows the <code>index</code> action Permission on the target Asset <code>http://example.com/archive1011</code>. The target asset is also declared as an <code>AssetCollection</code> to indicate the resource is a collection of resources. Another Asset relation <code>ex:summary</code> is also expressed to indicate the Asset <code>http://example.com/x/database</code> that the indexing output should be stored in.

<section id="asset-partof">
<h3>Part Of Property</h3> 	

<p>The <code>partOf</code> property is used to identify an AssetCollection that an Asset resource is a member of. The purpose is to explicitly express membership relationships between Assets and AssetCollections.  This enables a Rule that is related to an AssetCollection to understand which individual Assets the Rule may apply to. In addition, the Asset/AssetCollection membership relationships may potentially detect conflicts in Rules.</p>
	
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below snippet shows some Dublin Core metadata describing a document. The <code>odrl:partOf</code> property asserts that the Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:111.doc</code> is a member of the <code>http://example.com/archive1011</code> AssetCollection which is used in the Policy in the example above. This means that <code>http://example.com/asset:111.doc</code> is one of the target Assets in the Policy and can my indexed.</p>

<section id="policy-has">
<h3>Target Policy Property</h3> 
		   
<p>An ODRL Policy class MAY also be referenced by the <code>hasPolicy</code> property. This supports ODRL Policy Rules being the object of external metadata expressions (that identifies an Asset). When <code>hasPolicy</code> has been asserted between a metadata expression and an ODRL Policy, the Asset being identified MUST be inferred to be the <code>target</code> Asset of all the Rules of that Policy. If there are multiple Rules in the Policy, then the inferred Asset will be the target Asset to <strong>every</strong> Rule in the Policy.</p>
        
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below snippet shows some Dublin Core metadata describing a movie Asset. The <code>odrl:hasPolicy</code> property links to the ODRL Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:1010</code> (this is the Set Policy described above). In this case, the Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:9999.movie</code> is now also the target Asset for the Permission in Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:1010</code>. If there were additional Rules in this Policy, then the same Asset would be the target Asset to each Rule.</p>

<section id="party">
<h3>Party Class </h3>
    
<p>A Party Class is an entity or a collection of entities that undertake functional roles in a Rule, such as a person, collection of people, organisation, or agent. An agent is a person or thing that takes an active role or produces a specified effect. The Party performs (or does not perform) Actions or has a function in a Duty (i.e., assigns the Party to the Rule by associating it with the function it plays in the Rule).</p>

<p>The Party class has the following subclass:</p> 
<ul>
    <li><code>PartyCollection</code> - a Party that is a collection of entities. This indicates that all the entities in the collection will undertake the same functional role in the Rule.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>The Party class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Party SHOULD have one <code>uid</code> property to identify the Party using an IRI [[!rfc3987]].</li>
<li>A Party MUST have one and MAY have many <code><em>function</em></code> sub-properties for Party indicating the role undertaken by the Party.</li>
      <li>A Party MAY have none, one, or many <code>partOf</code> properties to identify (IRI [[!rfc3987]]) a PartyCollection that this Party is a member of.</li>
<li>A PartyCollection MAY have none, one, or many <code>constraint</code> properties for Constraint. See <a href="#constraint-party">Party Constraints</a> for more details.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">If a Party does not assert an identifier using the <code>uid</code> property, then the full implications must be understood, such as the impact on ODRL Validators and Evaluators of ODRL Policies.</p>
    

<p>The ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata for the Party class. It is recommended to use existing metadata standards, such as the W3C vCard Ontology [[vcard-rdf]] or FOAF Vocabulary [[foaf]].</p>
 
    
<section id="function">
<h4>Function Property</h4>

<p>A <code><em>function</em></code> property is used to link a Rule to a Party, indicating the function undertaken by the Party in respect to the Rule that links to it. The <code><em>function</em></code> property itself is abstract; sub-properties represent explicit semantics of the functional role between the Party and the Rule.</p>
 
<p>An ODRL validator MUST support the following sub-properties of <code><em>function</em></code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>assigner</code>: indicates the Party that is issuing the Rule. For example, the Party granting a Permission or requiring an agreed Duty to be performed.</li>
<li><code>assignee</code>: indicates that the Party that is the recipient the Rule. For example, the Party being granted a Permission or required to perform an agreed Duty.</li>
</ul>
 
    <p>Other <code><em>function</em></code> subtype properties SHOULD be defined in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] and ODRL Profiles.</p>
    

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The Policy shows an Agreement with two Parties with the functional roles of the <code>assigner</code> and the <code>assignee</code>. The <code>assigner</code> grants the <code>assignee</code> the play action over the target asset.</p>

<h3>Part Of Property</h3> 	
	
<p>The <code>partOf</code> property is used to identify a PartyCollection that a Party entity is a member of. The purpose is to explicitly express membership relationships between Parties and PartyCollections.  This enables a Rule that relates to a PartyCollection to understand which individual Parties the Rule may apply to. In addition, the Party/PartyCollection membership relationships may potentially detect conflicts in Rules.</p>
	
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The below snippet shows some vCard metadata describing a Party. The <code>odrl:partOf</code> property asserts that the Party <code>http://example.com/person/murphy</code> is a member of the <code>http://example.com/team/A</code> PartyCollection which is used in the Policy in the example above. This means that <code>http://example.com/person/murphy</code> is an assignee and can use the target asset in the Policy. </p>

<h3>Assigned Policy Properties</h3> 
		   
<p>An ODRL Policy class MAY also be referenced by the <code>assignerOf</code> and  <code>assigneeOf</code> properties. This supports ODRL Policy Rules being the object of external metadata expressions (that identifies a Party). When <code>assignerOf</code> has been asserted between a metadata expression and an ODRL Policy, the Party being identified MUST be inferred to undertake the <code>assigner</code> functional role of all the Rules of that Policy. When <code>assigneeOf</code> has been asserted between a metadata expression and an ODRL Policy, the Party being identified MUST be inferred to undertake the <code>assignee</code> functional role of all the Rules of that Policy.
	
	If there are multiple Rules in the Policy, then the inferred Party will undertake the functional role  to <strong>every</strong> Rule in the Policy.</p>

<section id="action">
<h3>Action Class</h3>


    <p>An Action class indicates an operation that can be applied to an Asset. An Action is associated with the Asset via the action property in a Rule.</p>
    
    <p>The Rule provides the specific interpretations of the Action. For example; an Action is <em>permitted</em> to be performed on the target Asset when related to a Permission. When related to a Prohibition, the Action indicates the operation that is <em>prohibited</em> to be performed on the target Asset. When related to a Duty, the Action indicates the agreed operation that is <em>obligatory</em> to be performed by a Party</p>
    
    <p>The ODRL Information Model defines the following top-level Actions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>use</code> - actions that involve general usage by parties. </li>
        <li><code>transfer</code> - actions that involve in the transfer of ownership to third parties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The Action class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Action MUST have one <code>includedIn</code> property for an Action to transitively assert this Action that encompasses its operational semantics.</li>
<li>An Action MAY have none or one <code>implies</code> property for an Action to assert this Action is not prohibited to enable its operational semantics.</li>    
</ul>
    
    <p>
     Action terms MUST be defined using the <code>includedIn</code> property referring to an encompassing Action and either <code>use</code> or <code>transfer</code> as the top-level parent term by transitive means.
      
        
        The purpose of the <code>includedIn</code> property is to explicitly assert that the semantics of the referenced instance of an other Action encompasses (includes) the semantics of this instance of Action. The <code>includedIn</code> property is transitive, and as such, the Actions form ancestor relationships.  </p>
        
       <p>The implication of the <code>includedIn</code> property is that a Permission or Prohibition of an encompassing Action is inherited by all Actions with an <code>includedIn</code> relationship.
        
         For example, if the <code>play</code> Action is defined as <code>includedIn</code> with <code>use</code> then if <code>play</code> is permitted in a Policy and <code>use</code> is prohibited in the same Policy - and both Actions apply to the same target Asset -  then because of this asserted relationship between the two, there is conflict in the Policy. (See <a href="#conflict">Policy Conflict Strategy</a> for more details.)</p>
        
        
     <p>       
         The <code>implies</code> property asserts that an instance of Action entails that the other instance of Action is not prohibited. The <code>implies</code> property can be used for Action instances which have no <code>includedIn</code> relationship.
         
         For example, if a <code>share</code> Action implies explicitly the <code>distribute</code> Action, then if <code>share</code> is permitted in a Policy and <code>distribute</code> is prohibited in the same Policy - and both Actions apply to the same target Asset - this would cause a conflict in the Policy. If an implied other action is not prohibited then this will not cause a conflict.
         (See <a href="#conflict">Policy Conflict Strategy</a> for more details.)
    
    <p>See <a href="#profile">ODRL Profiles</a> for usage details on the <code>includedIn</code> and <code>implies</code> properties.
    </p>
    
<p>The ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] defines a standard set of generic Actions that MAY be used and ODRL Profiles MAY also define Actions.</p>

    <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The Policy expresses an Offer for the target Asset <code>http://example.com/music:1012</code> with the Action to <code>play</code> the Asset (<code>play</code> is defined as an <code>includedIn</code> term of <code>use</code>).</p>

<section id="rule">
<h3>Rule Class</h3>


<p>The Rule class is the parent of the Permission, Prohibition, and Duty classes. The Rule class represents the common characteristics of these three classes.
</p>

<p>The Rule class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Rule MUST have one <code>action</code> property for Action.</li>
	<li>A Rule MAY have none or one <code><em>relation</em></code> sub-properties for Asset.</li>
	<li>A Rule MAY have none, one or many <code><em>function</em></code> sub-properties for Party.</li>
<li>A Rule MAY have none, one or many <code>constraint</code> properties for Constraint.</li>
<li>A Rule MAY have none or one <code>uid</code> property identifier (IRI [[!rfc3987]]) to enable the Rule to be referenced by other Rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explicit sub-properties of the abstract <code><em>relation</em></code> and <code><em>function</em></code> properties must be used, the choice depending on the subclass of Rule in question.</p>

<p>For a Rule to become effective, it MUST be valid (i.e., all it's Constraints MUST be satisfied).</p>

    
<section id="permission">
<h3>Permission Class</h3>


<p>A Permission is the <strong>ability</strong> to perform an Action over an Asset. The Permission class inherits all the properties from the Rule class parent.</p>

<p>The Permission class is a sublcass of Rule and has the following additional property semantics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A Permission MUST have one <code>target</code> property for Asset. (Other <code><i>relation</i></code> sub-properties for Asset MAY be used.)</li>
    <li>A Permission MAY have none, one, or more <code>assigner</code> and/or <code>assignee</code> property function roles for Parties. (Other <code><i>function</i></code> sub-properties for Party MAY be used.)</li>
    <li>A Permission MAY have none, one, or more <code>duty</code> properties for Duty.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Duty expresses an agreed obligation that MUST be fulfilled in order for the Permission to be valid. For a Permission to become effective, it MUST be valid (i.e., all it's constraints MUST be satisfied) and all of the Permission's Duties MUST be fulfilled.</p>
    
<blockquote>   
<p>Example Use Case: The Policy <code>Offer</code> from assigner <code>http://example.com/org:xyz</code> expresses the play Permission for the target Asset <code>http//example.com/game:9090</code> and the permission is valid until the end of the year 2017.</p>

<section id="prohibition">
<h3>Prohibition Class</h3>

<p>A Prohibition is the <strong>inability</strong> to perform an Action over an Asset. The Prohibition class inherits all the properties from the Rule class parent.</p>
    
<p>The Prohibition class is a sublcass of Rule and has the following additional property semantics:</p>
<ul>
	 <li>A Prohibition MUST have one <code>target</code> property for Asset. (Other <code><i>relation</i></code> sub-properties for Asset MAY be used.)</li>
    <li>A Prohibition MAY have none, one, or more <code>assigner</code> and/or <code>assignee</code> property function roles for Parties. (Other <code><i>function</i></code> sub-properties for Party MAY be used.)</li>

<section id="duty">
<h3>Duty Class</h3>

<p>A Duty is the <strong>obligation</strong> to perform an Action. The Duty specifies agreed Actions that MUST be fulfilled in order to be granted the associated Permission. A Duty MUST only be associated with a Permission. The Permission is valid (including the Permission's constraints all being satisfied) if and only if the Duty has been fulfilled. The Duty class inherits all the properties from the Rule class parent.</p>

	
	
<p>The Duty class is a sublcass of Rule and has the following additional property semantics:</p>
<ul>
     <li>A Duty MAY have none or one <code>target</code> property for Asset to indicate the Asset that is the primary subject to which the Duty directly applies. (Other <code><i>relation</i></code> sub-properties for Asset MAY be used.)</li>
	  <li>A Duty MAY have none, one, or more <code>assigner</code> and/or <code>assignee</code> property function roles for Parties. (Other <code><i>function</i></code> sub-properties for Party MAY be used.) If there are no <code>assigner</code> and/or <code>assignee</code> properties declared, then these functional roles will be the same as those declared in the refering Permission. </li>   
</ul>
    
	<p>The Duty class also has these additional requirements:</p>
	<ul>
	    <li>A Duty MUST only be associated with a Permission.</li> 
	   <li>The assignee MUST have the ability to perform the Duty Action.</li>
		<li>The assignee(s) of the Duty MUST satisfy the Duty.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
    
<p>If a Permission has several Duty entities then all of the Duties MUST be agreed to be satisfied for the Permission to be valid. If several Permissions refer to a single Duty, then the Duty only has to be satisfied <em>once</em> for all the Permissions to be valid.</p>
    
<p>Even though a Duty is mandatory (i.e., agreed to be undertaken by the Parties), the ODRL Information Model does not specify any specific temporal conditions on <em>WHEN</em> the Duty Action MUST be performed. Such business rules MAY be expressed through additional Constraints.  For example, a Policy may state that you can play a music file for a payment of $5.00. This does not indicate when the $5.00 should be paid as different business rules may apply, such as monthly invoicing or streaming.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: The Party <code>http://example.com/assigner:sony</code> makes an Offer to play the music file <code>http://example.com/music/1999.mp3</code>. There are two Duties that both must be satisfied for the <code>compensate</code> requirement. The first is the <code>payAmount</code> of $AUD5.00 and the second is the <code>event</code> of <code>policyUsage</code> must not have occurred yet (that is, the payment is made before the policy is exercised).

<section id="constraint">
<h3>Constraint Class</h3>
    
    <p>A Constraint class is a boolean expression that refines the applicability of a Rule, or the context of a Party or Asset Collection. Constraints can be represented as <strong>Atomic Constraints</strong> or as <strong>Compound Constraints</strong>. A Compound Constraint will refer to existing Atomic Constraints as its left and right operands. The evaluation of a Constraint is treated as a <em>black box</em> from an external system with the outcome of this evaluation determinig if the Constraint has been <em>satisfied</em> or not.</p>
    
    <p>ODRL Processors MUST check if a Constraint is satisfied at the time of processing the relevant Action, Asset, or Party. For a Rule, if the Constraint is satisfied then the action becomes effective for the enclosing Rule. For a Party/Asset Collection, if the Constraint is satisfied, then the (individual) Asset or Party becomes effective for the enclosing Rule.</p>
 
    <p>When multiple Constraints apply to the same Rule, Party/Asset Collection then they are interpreted as conjunction. A Rule becomes effective if all of its Constraints are satisfied. Parties and Assets become effective is all of the Constraints on Party/Asset Collections are satisfied. </p>
    
<section id="constraint-atomic">
<h3>Atomic Constraint</h3>
        
<p>Atomic Constraints are expressions for comparing two operands by one operator. If the  expression evaluates to <strong>true</strong> the Constraint is satisfied.
Atomic Constraints can express these contexts with comparison expressions. For example, the number of usages (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be smaller than (<code>operator</code>) the number 10 (<code>rightOperand</code>). 
</p>
       
<p>The Atomic Constraint class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MUST have one <code>leftOperand</code> property for Left Operands.</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MUST have one <code>operator</code> property for (relational) Operators.</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MUST have either one <code>rightOperand</code> property for right operand literal values or one <code>rightOperandReference</code> property for an IRI [[!rfc3987]] reference to a right operand literal value.</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MAY have none or one <code>dataType</code> property for the data type of the rightOperand/Reference.</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MAY have none or one <code>unit</code> property for the unit value of the rightOperand/Reference.</li>
<li>An Atomic Constraint MAY have none or one <code>status</code> property for the current value generated from the leftOperand action.</li>
</ul>
        
    
<p>The <code>leftOperand</code> MAY be one of the Constraint Left Operands defined in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] or from an ODRL Profile. The <code>leftOperand</code> MUST clearly be <strong>defined</strong> to indicate the subject of the constraint, and MAY show how the value for comparison has to be retrieved or generated. For example, the <code>count</code> constraint applies to the <code>action</code> and the <code>language</code> constraint applies to the <code>asset</code>.</p>
    
<p>The <code>operator</code> identifies the operation such as &#8220;greater than&#8221; or &#8220;equal to&#8221 between the left and right operands.</p>

<p>The <code>rightOperand</code> identifies the right operand of the logic expression. The <code>rightOperand</code> is the literal value of the Constraint that is to be compared to the <code>leftOperand</code>. The <code>rightOperandReference</code> represents an IRI that MUST be de-referenced first to obtain the actual literal value of the <code>rightOperand</code>. A <code>rightOperandReference</code> is used in cases where the value of the <code>rightOperand</code> MUST be obtained from dereferencing an IRI first.  Only one of <code>rightOperand</code> or <code>rightOperandReference</code> MUST appear in the Atomic Constraint.</p>

    <p><blockquote>
The <code>rightOperand</code> represents a literal value and the <code>rightOperandReference</code> represents an IRI that must be de-referenced. If the <code>rightOperand</code> was <code>http://example.com/c100</code> then that is interpreted as the value to be compared in the  expression. If the <code>rightOperandReference</code>  was the same value of <code>http://example.com/c100</code>, then that IRI must be de-referenced first and the data returned must be interpreted as the value to be compared in the  expression.
  </blockquote> </p> 
   
        
<p>The <code>dataType</code> indicates the type of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as <code>xsd:decimal</code> or <code>xsd:datetime</code> and the <code>unit</code> indicates the unit value of the <code>rightOperand/Reference</code>, such as &#8220;EU currency&#8221;.</p>

<p>The <code>status</code> provides the current value generated from the <code>leftOperand</code> action. For example, a <code>count</code> constraint could have a <code>rightOperand</code> value of 10, and the <code>status</code> of 5. This means that the action has already been exercised 5 times.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: In the first example below, the Party <code>http://example.com/myPix:6161</code> wants to offer the  <code>distribute</code> Permission for a specific country for the target Asset. The offer has two Duties to <code>compensate</code> the assigner and a <code>nextPolicy</code>. The potential assignee may distribute the target Asset <code>http://example.com/wallpaper:1234</code> according to the Policy target Asset. The second example shows that the Policy  <code>http://example.com/policy:7171</code> stipulates  the potential assignee may only offer the <code>display</code> Permission to other parties.</p>

<h3>Compound Constraint</h3>
 
 <p>   
    Compound Constraints refer to two existing Atomic Constraints as the left and right operand. For example, Atomic Constraint #1 (<code>leftOperand</code>) must be satisfied <strong>or</strong> (<code>operator</code>) Atomic Constraint #2 (<code>rightOperand</code>) must be satisfied. The Compound Constraint operator identifiers the logical relationship between the two Atomic Constraints using operators such as <strong>and</strong> or <strong>exclusive or</strong>.</p>

      
<p>The Compound Constraint class has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Compound Constraint MUST have one <code>leftOperand</code> property for Atomic Constaints.</li>
<li>A Compound Constraint MUST have one <code>operator</code> property for (logical) Operators.</li>
<li>A Compound Constraint MUST have one <code>rightOperand</code> property for Atomic Constraints.</li>
</ul>
        
    
<p>The applicable logical <code>operator</code> that MAY be used for Compound Constraint are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>or</code> -  at least one of the Atomic Constraints (in the left or right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>xor</code> - only one of the Atomic Constraints (in the left or right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>and</code> - both of the Atomic Constraints (in the left and right operand) MUST be satisfied</li>
    <li><code>andSequence</code> - the left operand Atomic Constraint must deliver a satisfied result before the right operand Atomic Constraint is evaluated.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other <code>operator</code> values are defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]], further values may be defined by ODRL Profiles.</p>
    
<p>The <code>andSequence</code> operator is an example where there are temporal conditional requirements between the left and right operands. This may lead to situations where the outcome is unresolvable, such as <em>deadlock</em> if one of the Atomic Constraints is unable to be satisfied. ODRL Processing systems SHOULD plan for these scenarios and implement mechanisms to resolve them.</p>
    
<p>The processing model for Compound Constraints includes:</p>
    <ol>
       <li>The left and right operands MUST both be Atomic Constraints.</li>
         <li>The left and right operands MUST NOT be the same Atomic Constraint.</li>
        <li>The <code>operator</code> MUST only be of the values; <code>or</code>, <code>xor</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>andSequence</code>. Other values MAY be defined in ODRL Profiles exclusively for the use of Compound Constraints.</li>
       <li>If the <code>operator</code> is <code>or</code> then at least one of the Atomic Constraints (in the left or right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Compound Constraint to be satisfied.</li> 
        <li>If the <code>operator</code> is <code>xor</code> then at only one of the Atomic Constraints (in the left or right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Compound Constraint to be satisfied.</li>  
        <li>If the <code>operator</code> is <code>and</code> then both of the Atomic Constraints (in the left and right operands) MUST be satisfied for the entire Compound Constraint to be satisfied.</li>
        <li>If the <code>operator</code> is <code>andSequence</code> then the left operand Atomic Constraint MUST return a satisfied result then the right operand Atomic Constraint MUST be evaluated and be satisfied.</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Asset Constraint</h3>
 
 <p>   
	 Atomic Constraints MAY be applied to an <code>AssetCollection</code> to indicate the context under which to identify the individual Asset(s) that are effective to the Rule. The constraint applies to the characteristics of each member of the collection (and not the resource as a whole). </p>
	 
	<p>Note that when using Atomic Constraints, the <code>uid</code> property MUST NOT be used to identify the <code>AssetCollection</code>. Instead, the <code>source</code> property MUST be used to refer to the <code>AssetCollection</code>. </p>

    <p>Example Use Case: The Policy defines a target source <code>http://example.com/media-catalogue</code> that is an AssetCollection of multimedia images. The target  also has a constraint that specifies further context on the characteristics of the AssetCollection items. In this case, the target Assets will be no more than 50 resources from the media catalogue, and each of those may be printed.</p>
        <p>The <code>ex:set</code> leftOperand is defined in the ODRL Profile <code>http://example.com/profiles/01</code>. It is considered good practice that the  profile URIs are not mere identifiers but de-reference to human- and machine-readable documentation.

<h4>Policy Rule Composition</h4>
             
    <p>A Policy MAY be related to multiple Rules, and each Rule MAY be related to multiple Assets, Parties, Actions, Constraints, and Duties. A Policy MAY also be related to Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level, and these relationships apply to all of the enclosing Rules in the Policy.</p>
     
    <p>At the core level, an ODRL Rule would be related to one Asset, one or more Parties, one Action, and potentially one Constraint and/or Duty, as shown in the example below. This example shows the <em>atomic</em> level of a Policy where it is an irreducible Rule (that is, not able to be reduced or further simplified).</p>
             
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:7777",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
    }]
} 
</pre>

<p>As multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions can be expressed for each Rule, the following example shows two Assets defined for the policy:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": [ "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
                    "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3"],
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
    }]
}
</pre>

<p>The above example could then be reduced to two <em>atomic</em> Rules, with the two target assets appearing individually in each:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
    },
    {
        "target": "http://example.com/music/PurpleRain.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "action": "play",
        "constraint": "...",
        "duty": "..."
    }]
}
</pre>
    
    <p>In order to create the <em>atomic</em> Rules in a Policy, the processing model for policies with multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Where there are multiple Assets (with the same relation), then create new Rules (one for each of these Assets) and include only one Asset relation, and include all other (non-Asset) properties, in each Rule</li>
    <li>Where there are multiple Parties (with the same function), then create new Rules (one for each of these Parties) and include only one Party function, and include all other (non-Party) properties, in each Rule.</li>
    <li>Where there are multiple Actions, then create new Rules (one for each of these Actions) and include only one Action, and include all other (non-Action) properties, in each Rule.</li>
    </ol>
      
<section id="composition-compact">
<h4>Compact Policy</h4>
	
    <p>An ODRL Policy MAY also relate to multiple Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy level (not just within a specific Rule). This is a <em>short-cut</em> method to support more <strong>compact</strong> serialisations. This method implies that these related classes are common to all the Rules in the Policy, as shown in the below example:</p>
             
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
    "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
    "action": "play",
    "permission": [{
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy"
        }]
}  
</pre>

<p>To fully expand the Rules, the Policy-level related Assets, Parties, and Actions MUST be added to all the Rules in the Policy. As shown below, the policy-level target, assigner, and action (from the above example) are added to the two permission Rules:</p>
    
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:8888",
    "permission": [{
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/billie",
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "play"
        },
        {
        "assignee": "http://example.com/people/murphy",
        "target": "http://example.com/music/1999.mp3",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/org/sony-music",
        "action": "play",
        }]
}  
</pre>  
  
    <p>The processing model for Policies with multiple related Assets, Parties, and Actions at the Policy-level includes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Assets in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
   <li>Replicate all Policy-level Parties in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
    <li>Replicate all Policy-level Actions in each and all Permission/Prohibition Rules.</li>
      <li>Follow the processing model (defined above) to create <em>atomic</em> Rules in the Policy.</li>  
    </ol>
       
    <p>It is RECOMMENDED that compact ODRL Policies be expanded to atomic Policies when being processed for conformance or exchanged for interoperability, to reflect the normative ODRL Information Model.</p>

     <section id="provenace">
<h4>Policy Metadata</h4>
         
       <p>Additional properties MAY be added to a Policy to support further authenticity, and integrity purposes from external vocabularies. The ODRL Information Model recommends the use of Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[dcterms]] for ODRL Policies.</p>
         
         <p>The following Dublin Core Metadata Terms [[dcterms]] properties SHOULD be used:</p>
            <ul>
         <li><code>dc:creator</code> - the individual, agent, or organisation that authored the Policy.</li>      <li><code>dc:description</code> - a human-readable representation or summary of the Policy.</li>
         <li><code>dc:issued</code> - the date (and time) the Policy was first issued.</li>
         <li><code>dc:modified</code> -  the date (and time) the Policy was updated.</li>

    <p>The processing model for Policies with the above provenance properties include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>If a Policy has the <code>dc:isReplacedBy</code> property, then a processor MUST consider the first Policy invalid and MUST retrieve and process the identified Policy.</li>

<h4>Policy Inheritance</h4>

    <p>ODRL supports a simple inheritance mechanism in which a (child) Policy may inherit all the atomic Rules of the (parent) Policy.</p>
    
<p>The <code>inheritAllowed</code> property in the Policy is used to indicate if the Policy expression can be used in any inheritance relationship. If present, the value of the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code>: the Policy expression MAY be used for inheritance</li>
<li><code>false</code>: the Policy expression MUST NOT be used for inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property is not explicitly set, its default value of <code>true</code> will be used.</p>
    
<p>The following property SHOULD be used in a child Policy that is inheriting from a parent Policy in which that parent Policy MUST allow inheritance (via the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property) :</p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>inheritFrom</code>: the identifier (<code>uid</code>) of the parent Policy from which this child Policy inherits from</li>
    </ul>


<p>The following restrictions apply when using inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single inheritance is only supported. That is, one parent Policy to one or more child Policies. No child Policy can inherit from two or more parent Policies.</li>
<li>Inheritance can be to any depth. (Multiple levels of children Policies.)</li>
<li>Inheritance MUST NOT be circular.</li>
<li>No constraint <code>status</code> information is transferred from the parent Policy to the child Policy. That is, if the parent Policy had <code>status</code> properties with values, then these values would be nulled.</li>
</ul>

    <blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: Consider the parent Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:default</code> below that has been expressed primarily for inheritance purposes (the assigner wishes to provide default permissions for all Policies). It does not refer to any target Asset and allows the archive and annotate Permissions and disallows the aggregate Prohibition.</p>

<p>After the inheritance is performed - where the (parent) Policy atomic Rules are added to the (child) Policy - the resulting Policy is shown below. As this is an Agreement Policy, the assignee also becomes part of the inherited Prohibition.</p>

    <li>A (child) Policy with an <code>inheritFrom</code> property MUST first verify that the (parent) Policy does not have the <code>inheritAllowed</code> property with the value <strong>false</strong>.</li>
        <li>The (child) Policy MUST access the (parent) Policy and replicate the following in the (child) Policy:
       <ul>
           <li>All policy-level Assets, Parties, Actions.</li>
           <li>All Permission and Prohibition Rules.</li>
       </ul>
            </li>
      <li>The (child) Policy can then be further expanded (into <em>atomic</em> Rules) by following the processing models defined in the <a href="#composition">Policy Composition</a> section.</li>  
    </ol>
        
	
</section>
    
<section id="conflict">
<h4>Policy Conflict Strategy</h4>
        
<p>The <code>conflict</code> property is used to establish strategies to resolve conflicts that arise from the merging of Policies or conflicts between Permissions and Prohibitions in the same Policy. Conflicts may arise when merging Policies as a result of <a href="#inhertiance">Policy Inheritance</a> and the resultant Rules are inconsistent.</p>
      
    <p>The <code>conflict</code> property SHOULD take one of the following Conflict Strategy Preference values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perm</code>: the Permissions MUST override the Prohibitions</li>
<li><code>prohibit</code>: the Prohibitions MUST override the Permissions</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the entire Policy MUST be invalid if any conflict is detected</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>conflict</code> property is not explicitly set, the default of <code>invalid</code> will be used. <p>Other <code>conflict</code> property values MAY be defined in the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] and ODRL Profiles.</p></p>

        
<p>If an ODRL processor does not detect any conflicts in the Rules, then the ODRL Policy is valid, otherwise the ODRL processor MUST follow these processing rules:</p>
   
<ol>
        <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>perm</code> then any conflicting Permission Rule MUST override the Prohibition Rule and continue with the Policy as valid.</li>
 <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>prohibit</code> then any conflicting Prohibition Rule MUST override the Permission Rule and continue with the Policy as valid.</li>
  <li>If a Policy has the <code>conflict</code> property of <code>invalid</code> then  processing MUST not continue and the entire Policy MUST be invalid.</li> 
 <li>If a Policy has multiple <code>conflict</code> property values (for example, after a Policy merge or inheritance) then processing MUST not continue and the entire Policy MUST be invalid.</li> 
        </ol>
       
        
<blockquote>
<p>Example Use Case: Two Policies are associated to the same target Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:1212</code>. The first Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:0001</code> allows to <code>use</code> the Asset. The second Policy <code>http://example.com/policy:0002</code> allows for the display of the Asset, but it prohibits <code>print</code>. Both policies explicitly state how to deal with conflicts through the <code>conflict</code> property being set to <code>perm</code>. Hence the Permissions will always override any Prohibitions. In this use case, since the <code>print</code> Action is a specialisation of the <code>use</code> Action, there could be a conflict. However, the <code>perm</code> conflict strategy means that the <code>use</code> Permission will override the <code>print</code> Prohibition.</p>
</blockquote>

        
<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:0001",
    "conflict": "perm",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/asset:1212",
        "action": "use",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/owner:181"
    }]
}
</pre>

<pre class="example hljs json">
{
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Policy",
    "uid": "http://example.com/policy:0002",
    "conflict": "perm",
    "permission": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/asset:1212",
        "action": "display",
        "assigner": "http://example.com/owner:182"
    }],
    "prohibition": [{
        "target": "http://example.com/asset:1212",
        "action": "print"
    }]
}
</pre>

<p>In the above use case, if the second Policy had the conflict value of <code>prohibit</code>, then the outcome would be a direct contradiction, and the result will be an invalid Policy.</p>

<h2>ODRL Profiles</h2>

    <section id="profile-motivation">
    <h3>ODRL Profile Purpose</h3>
        
<p>The ODRL Information Model serves as a core framework and vocabulary to express Policies. The ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] provides a generic range of common actions for Permissions, Prohibition, and Duties as well as Policy subclasses, Constraint left operands and operators, Asset relations, and Party functions. For some communities, this flexibility and wide-range of terms supports their requirements for policy expression. Other communities may wish to have a more focussed and specific set of terms that meets their sector's requirements more precisely. 
</p>
        
        <p>In this latter case, it is recommended that a community create and document an ODRL Profile. An ODRL Profile directly and explicitly serves their communities needs by specifying only the terms they wish to support in ODRL expressions. These terms may come from the ODRL Common Vocabulary or may be created as new terms.</p>
        
    </section>
    
    <section id="profile-requirements">
    <h3>ODRL Profile Mechanism</h3>
      
<p>
    In an ODRL Policy, the <code>profile</code> property is used to indicate the identifier (IRI) of the ODRL Profile for which the Policy expression conforms to. This property is OPTIONAL, but if the property appears, then any ODRL consuming system that supports/implements the given profile MUST understand the identified ODRL Profile. If an ODRL consuming system does not understand the ODRL Profile, then it MAY continue processing the Policy expression, but it SHOULD NOT assume it has interpreted the Policy expression correctly.</p>
    
   
<p>
An ODRL Profile extends the ODRL Information Model classes, properties, and instances in the following ways:
   </p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Additional Policy Subclasses - create a subclass the ODRL Policy class:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><code>ex:myPolicyType rdfs:subClassOf odrl:Policy ;</code></li></ul>
    
<blockquote>
 <p>Additional Asset Relationships - create a sub-property of the abstract <em>relation</em> property:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><code>ex:myRelation rdfs:subPropertyOf odrl:relation ;</code></li></ul>

<blockquote>
 <p>Additional Party Functional roles - create a sub-property of the abstract <em>function</em> property:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><code>ex:myFunctionRole	rdfs:subPropertyOf odrl:function ;</code></li></ul>

<blockquote>
 <p>Additional Actions for Rules - create an instance of a Action and define its includedIn parent Action:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><code>ex:myAction a :Action ;</code></li>
    <li><code>ex:myAction odrl:includedIn odrl:use ;</code></li></ul>
        
<p>The new Action MAY be defined as <code>includedIn</code> to any existing Action. </p>
<p>If the new Action forms a dependency with another new or existing Action, then define the two actions with the <code>implies</code> property:</p>
    <ul><li><code>ex:myAction odrl:implies odrl:distribute ;</code></li></ul>    
        
<blockquote>
    <p>Additional Constraint left operands - create an instance of the LeftOperand class:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><code>ex:myLeftOperand a odrl:LeftOperand ;</code></li></ul>
        
<blockquote>
    <p>Additional Constraint right operands - create an instance of the RightOperand class:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><code>ex:myRightOperand a odrl:RightOperand ;</code></li></ul>
        
<blockquote>
    <p>Additional Constraint operators - create an instance of the Operator class:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><code>ex:myOperator a :Operator ;</code></li></ul>
        
<blockquote>
    <p>Additional Policy Conflict strategies - create an instance of the ConflictTerm class:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul><li><code>:myStrategy a :ConflictTerm ;</code></li></ul>
        
<blockquote>
    <p>Additional Rule class - create a subclass of the Rule class and define it as disjoint with the other Rule subclasses:</p>
</blockquote>
    <li><code>:myRule	rdfs:subClassOf :Rule ; </code></li>
	<li><code>owl:disjointWith :Prohibition, :Duty :Permission ; </code></li></ul>

    <p>All new classes, properties, and instances must also be defined as a <code>skos:Concept</code>. Appropriate <code>rdfs:domain</code> and <code>rdfs:range</code> should also be defined.</p>
    <p>Human-readable documentation is also recommended for each new term using  <code>rdfs:label</code> for the name, <code>skos:definition</code> for the formal definition, and <code>skos:note</code> for additional comments on its use.</p>

<section id="privacyConsiderations" class="informative">

<h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    The ODRL Information Model does not directly express sensitive personal information such as the identity of the existence of Assets containing such data related to Parties. However, ODRL vocabularies (such as the ODRL Common Vocabulary [[!odrl-vocab]] and ODRL Profiles) may define terms that may relate to personal information. These specifications should inform implementations that produce or consume such ODRL expressions to take steps to communicate to all relevant users the manner in which the policy is being used, the identity of any other party with whom that policy is being shared, and the reason the policy is being shared with other parties.

<h2>Relationship to the W3C ODRL Community Group Reports</h2>

    
<p>The basis for the deliverables for the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group are the reports created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a>. The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support innovative expression of  asset usage for the publication, distribution and consumption of content services.
The final outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE).</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
The ODRL Information Model was derived from the ODRL V2.1 Core Model Community Group report. Details of the differences between the W3C Working Group deliverables and the ODRL Community Group Reports are maintained in the <a href="#changes">Appendix</a>. All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>
