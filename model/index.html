    <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) provides a flexible and interoperable information model, vocabulary, and encoding mechanisms for describing statements about digital content usage. The ODRL Information Model describes the underlying concepts, entities, and relationships that form the foundational basis for the semantics of the ODRL statements. </p>
        <p>Policies are used to explicitly state what are the permitted and prohibited actions over a certain resource. In addition, policies may be integrated with complex constraints (e.g., time constraints) which apply to such actions to impose further restrictions to the uses of the resource. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>   

<p>Several business scenarios require to express what are the permitted and prohibited actions over digital content. These permitted/prohibited actions are usually expressed under the form of policies, i.e., entities that allow to indicate those uses and re-uses of the digital content which are comform with the existing regulations or to the constraints assigned by the owner. Policies may also be enriched with additional information, i.e., who are the entities in charge of the definition of such policy and those who are required to conform to it, what are the additional constrains to be associated with the permissions, prohibitions and duties expressed by the policy. The ability to express these concepts and relationships is important both for the producers of digital content, i.e., they may state in a clear way what are the permitted and the prohibited actions to prevent misuses, and for the consumers, i.e., they may know precisely how they are allowed to use and re-use the digital content to avoid breaking the law or the owner's constraints. This specification describes a common approach to expressing these concepts, and more.</p>
<p>The ODRL Information Model defines the underlying semantic model for permissions and obligations statements describing digital content usage. The information model covers the core concepts, entities and relationships that provide the foundational model for content usage statements. These machine-readable policies may be linked directly with the digital content they are associated to with the aim to allow consumers to easily retrieve those information.</p>
     
<section id="aimsModel">
<h3>Aims of the Model</h3>

<p>The primary aim of the ODRL Information Model is to provide a standard description model and format to express permission and obligation statements to be associated to digital content in general. These permission and obligation statements are employed to describe the terms of use and reuse of digital resources. The model should cover as many permission and obligation use cases as possible, while keeping the policy modeling easy even when dealing with complex uses.</p>

<p>The ODRL Information Model is a single, consistent model that can be used by all interested parties. All efforts have been made to keep the implementation costs for both digital content producers and consumers to a minimum. A single method of fulfilling a use case is strongly preferred over multiple methods, unless there are existing standards that need to be accommodated or there is a significant cost associated with using only a single method. While the Information Model is built using Linked Data principles, the design is intended to allow non-graph-based implementations also. </p>

<h2>Relationship to the W3C ODRL Community Group Reports</h2>

    
<p>The basis for the deliverables for the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group are the reports created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a>. The ODRL Community Group has developed a family of specifications to support innovative expression of digital asset usage for the publication, distribution and consumption of content services.
The final outputs of the ODRL Community Group were the ODRL Version 2.1 specifications that were a major update for ODRL and superseded the original ODRL Version 1.1 [[odrl]] (published as a W3C NOTE).</p>
    
<p>The following documents are part of the ODRL Community Group report series:</p>
<ul>
<li>ODRL V2 Requirements [[odrl2-req]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Core Model [[odrl21-model]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Common Vocabulary [[odrl21-vocab]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 XML Encoding [[odrl21-xml]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 Ontology [[odrl21-onto]]</li>
<li>ODRL V2.1 JSON Encoding [[odrl21-json]]</li>
</ul>

 <p>
The ODRL Information Model was derived from the ODRL V2.1 Core Model Community Group report. Details of the differences between the W3C Working Group deliverables and the ODRL Community Group Reports are maintained in the <a href="#community">Appendix</a>. All new ODRL implementations are expected to use the deliverables of the Permissions &amp; Obligations Expression Working Group. </p>

<h2>ODRL Information Model</h2>


<p>The basic context of an ODRL Policy is that only an explicitly permitted use may be executed. Any use not explicitly permitted is prohibited by default. An ODRL Policy only permits the action explicitly specified in a Permission and all other actions are implicitly prohibited. An action defined in a Prohibition should only refine (or directly relate to) the semantics of an action defined in one of the Permissions in the ODRL Policy.</p>
    
<p>For example, an ODRL Policy that has the action &#8220;present&#8221; Permission and may also have the action &#8220;print&#8221; Prohibition (as these actions are related hierarchically in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]]).</p>
<p>Note that ODRL Profiles can be developed and used to refine the basic context of an ODRL Policy. Hence, the application of an ODRL Profile must be understood by the consuming community and systems.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the ODRL Information Model. The <code>Policy</code> is the central entity that holds an ODRL policy together. </p>

<figure>
	<img src="fig/00Model.png" alt="ODRL Information Model" width="800"/>
    <figcaption>ODRL Information Model</figcaption>
</figure>

  
    
<p>As the Information Model diagram shows the key <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code> and <code>Duty</code> entities are subtypes of the abstract <code><em>Rule</em></code> class and they have the same relationships to the other key entities (<code>Action</code>, <code>Constraint</code>, <code>Asset</code>, and <code>Party</code>). The core difference is in their semantics:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Permission</code> says that the <code>assignee </code> MAY perform an action,</li>
<li><code>Duty</code> says that the <code>assignee</code> MUST perform an action, and</li>
<li><code>Prohibition</code> says that the <code>assignee</code> MUST NOT perform an action.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code><em>Rule</em></code> class also makes it possible to easily extend the Information Model in Profiles by adding policy expressions (as subclasses of <code><em>Rule</em></code>) that are not possible by default.</p>
    
<p>The cardinalities shown in the ODRL Information Model allow for the greatest flexibility in expressing associations between the key entities. However, <code>Policy Types</code> and <code>ODRL Profiles</code> may express narrower and/or specific cardinalities on these entities.</p>

<p>A <code>Permission</code> MAY allow a particular <code>Action</code> to be executed on a related <code>Asset</code>, e.g. &#8220;play the audio file abc.mp3&#8221;. A <code>Constraint</code> like &#8220;at most 10 times&#8221; might be added to specify the <code>Permission</code> more precisely. The <code>Party</code> that grants this <code>Permission</code> is linked to it with the <code>Role</code> <code>assigner</code>, the <code>Party</code> that is granted the <code>Permission</code> is linked to it with the <code>Role</code> <code>assignee</code>, e.g. &#8220;<code>assigner</code> VirtualMusicShop grants the <code>Permission</code> to <code>assignee</code> Alice&#8221;. Additionally, a <code>Permission</code> MAY be linked to <code>Duty</code> entities.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>Permission</code>s, a <code>Duty</code> states that a certain <code>Action</code> MUST be executed by the <code>Party</code> with the <code>Role</code> <code>assignee</code> for the <code>Permission</code> to be valid, e.g. &#8220;Alice must pay 5 EUR in order to get the <code>Permission</code> to play abc.mp3&#8243;.</p>
    
<p>The <code>Prohibition</code> entity is used in the same way as <code>Permission</code>, with the difference that it MUST NOT refer to <code>Duties</code> and that the <code>Action</code> MUST NOT be exercised, e.g. &#8220;Alice is forbidden to use abc.mp3 commercially&#8221;.</p>
    
<p>The following sections describes each entity of the Information Model in greater detail.</p>

<section id="policy">
<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>The <code>Policy</code> entity is the top-level entity and contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the <code>Policy</code> entity (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>type</code>: indicates the semantics of the <code>Policy</code> entity (REQUIRED). These are further described in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] and ODRL Profiles.</li>
<li><code>conflict</code>: indicates how to handle <code>Policy</code> conflicts (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>undefined</code>: indicates how to handle undefined <code>Action</code>s (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>inheritAllowed</code>: indicates if the <code>Policy</code> entity can be inherited (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>profile</code>: the identifier of the ODRL Profile that this <code>Policy</code> conforms to (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>uid</code> attribute MUST be a unique identifier.</p>
<p>The range of values for the <code>Policy</code> entity&#8217;s <code>type</code> attribute will be described in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or in ODRL Profiles. This value MAY also impose further constraints on the Information Model, such as are exemplified in the Scenarios for types <code>Offer</code> and <code>Agreement</code>. It is important that the <code>type</code> attribute be clearly understood in policy expressions as the semantics MAY impose restrictions on the expression language constructs such as cardinalities between entities.</p>

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: A Policy of type Set states that the Asset <code>http//example.com/asset:9898</code> is the target of the Permission read and the Prohibition reproduce. No parties or other elements are involved.</p>

<p>The <code>conflict</code> attribute is used either to resolve conflicts arising from the merging of policies, specifically when there are conflicting <code>Action</code>s in the <code>Permission</code>s and <code>Prohibition</code>s, or to set priorities over the <code>Permission</code>s/<code>Prohibition</code>s in the same policy. If present, the <code>conflict</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>perm</code>: the <code>Permission</code>s will always takes preference</li>
<li><code>prohibit</code>: the <code>Prohibition</code>s will always takes preference</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the policy is invalid</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>conflict</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value will be used instead. The default value of the <code>conflict</code> attribute is <code>invalid</code>.</p>
    
      <div class="issue" data-number="21">
          <p>Need to clarify conflicting values of the conflict attribute. That is, one policy says <code>perm</code> and the other <code>prohibit</code>. </p>
    </div>
    
    
<p>The <code>undefined</code> attribute is used to indicate how to support <code>Action</code>s that are not part of any profile in the policy expression system. If present, the <code>undefined</code> attribute MUST take one of<br />
the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>support</code>: the undefined <code>Action</code> is to be supported as part of the policy &#8211; and the policy remains valid</li>
<li><code>ignore</code>: the undefined <code>Action</code> is to be ignored and is not part of the policy &#8211; and the policy remains valid</li>
<li><code>invalid</code>: the <code>Action</code> is unknown &#8211; and the policy is invalid</li>
</ul>
<p>In the <code>support</code> case, even though the <code>Action</code> is unknown, the policy still is valid and the consuming parties or system of the policy MUST be made aware of the unknown <code>Action</code>. This MAY be via a user interface that displays the unknown <code>Action</code> for human readability.</p>
<p>In the <code>ignore</code> case, even though the <code>Action</code> is unknown, the policy still is valid and the consuming parties or system of the policy MAY be made aware of the unknown <code>Action</code>.</p>
<p>In the <code>invalid</code> case with the unknown <code>Action</code>, the policy is invalid and the consuming parties or system of the policy MUST be made aware of this.</p>
<p>If the <code>undefined</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value will be used instead. The default value of the <code>undefined</code> attribute is <code>invalid</code>.</p>
<p>Other attributes MAY be added to the <code>Policy</code> entity to support additional functions and requirements. Typically, these will be from different community vocabularies. For example, to indicate the issued date or valid dates of the <code>Policy</code> entity, use of the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" rel="external nofollow">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> would be recommended.</p>
    
<section id="inhertiance">
<h4>Inheritance</h4>

    <div class="issue" data-number="22">
        <p>We need to make clear exactly what gets inherited and what gets overriden (if anything)</p>
    </div>
    
    
<p>The <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute in the <code>Policy</code> entity is used to indicate if the <code>Policy</code> expression can be used in any inheritance relationship. If present, the value of the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute MUST take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code>: the <code>Policy</code> expression can be used for inheritance</li>
<li><code>false</code>: the <code>Policy</code> expression can not be used for inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute is not explicitly set, its default value will be used instead. The default value of the <code>inherit</code> attribute is <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>Only if the <code>inheritAllowed</code> attribute has the value <code>true</code> MAY the following be used:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><code>inheritFrom</code>: the identifier from which this <code>Policy</code> inherits from it&#8217;s parent <code>Policy</code> (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>inheritRelation</code>: the identifier for the relationship type of this inheritance structure (OPTIONAL)</li>
    </ul>
    
    
<p>The <code>inheritFrom</code> association in the (child) <code>Policy</code> will uniquely identify (via a UID) the (parent) <code>Policy</code> from which the inheritance will be performed.</p>
<p>The <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute in the (child) <code>Policy</code> will uniquely identify (via a UID) the type of inheritance from the (parent) <code>Policy</code>. For example, this may indicate the business scenario, such as <em>subscription</em>, or prior arrangements between the parties (that are not machine representable). Such terms MAY be defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or ODRL Profiles. For example, an Assigner and Assignee may have a historical arrangement related to the specific use of content they make available to each other. The business model (identified with a URI) is used in the <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute in their subsequent ODRL policies they exchange. This will require the ODRL policy to be interpreted with the additional information identified by the URI. For example, this may include additional permission actions or constraints (etc) that is documented in their business model arrangement.</p>
<p>Both the <code>inheritFrom</code> association and <code>inheritRelation</code> attribute MAY be used independently.</p>
<p>The following restrictions apply when using inheritance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single inheritance is only supported. (One Parent <code>Policy</code> to one or more Child <code>Policy</code> entities. No Child <code>Policy</code> can inherit from two or more Parent <code>Policy</code> entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance can be to any depth. (Multiple levels of Children <code>Policy</code> entities.)</li>
<li>Inheritance cannot be circular.</li>
<li>The Child <code>Policy</code> MUST override the Parent <code>Policy</code>. i.e.: If the same <code>Action</code> appears in the Parent, then it is replaced by the Child version, otherwise the Parent <code>Action</code>s are added to the Child&#8217;s <code>Action</code>s.</li>
<li>No state information is transferred from the policy in the Parent <code>Policy</code> to the Child <code>Policy</code></li>
</ul>
	
<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: This example explains the use of inheritance by means of two parent Policies and two child Policies. 
On the one side, the instance of the child Policy <code>http://example.com/child_policy:2222</code> inherits from the parent Policy <code>http://example.com/parent_policy:1111</code>, allowing to reproduce the parent's target Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:1111</code>, and allowing the Party <code>http://example.com/assignee:88</code> to read the child's target Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:2222</code>. Moreover, due to the inheritance relation, the child Policy inherits from the parent that the Party <code>http://example.com/assignee:88</code> can also reproduce <code>http://example.com/asset:1111</code>.<br> 

On the other side, the instance of the child Policy <code>http://example.com/child_policy:1111</code> inherits from the parent Policy <code>http://example.com/parent_policy:2222</code>, allowing to distribute the parent's target Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:3333</code>, and allowing the Party <code>http://example.com/assignee:88</code> to play and distribute the child's target Asset <code>http://example.com/asset:4444</code>. In this case, the child Policy overrides the parent one, meaning that as the same Action appears in the parent and in the child (i.e., <code>distribute</code>), then it is replaced by the child version, so that the Party <code>http://example.com/assignee:88</code> can also distribute <code>http://example.com/asset:3333</code>. <br>

Note that, following the definition of inheritance provided above, the child Policy <code>http://example.com/child_policy:1111</code> cannot inherit from parent Policy <code>http://example.com/parent_policy:1111</code>, even if inheritance is allowed from this Policy, because no child Policy can inherit from two or more parent Policy entities.

<h3>Asset</h3>
<p>The <code>Asset</code> entity is the subject of an ODRL policy expression that permissions and prohibitions are applied to. The Asset entity can be any form of identifiable resource, such as data/information, content/media, applications, or services. Furthermore, it can be used to represent other <code>Asset</code> entities that are needed to undertake the Policy expression, such as with the <code>Duty</code> entity. The <code>Asset</code> entity is referred to by the <code>Permission</code> and/or <code>Prohibition</code> entities, and also by the <code>Duty</code> entity.</p>
<p>The <code>Asset</code> entity contains the following attribute:</p>

<li><code>uid</code>: the unique identification of the <code>Asset</code> (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The identification of the <code>Asset</code> entity is a key foundation of the ODRL Policy language. However, there are some use cases where the ODRL Policy expression MAY be embedded inside the target <code>Asset</code>. In these cases, it MAY be more appropriate to provide, or infer, a link to the <code>Asset</code> entity (as the complete <code>Asset</code> <code>uid</code> may not be known at the time) through the local context. Use of such inference and context MUST be documented in the relevant ODRL Profile.</p>
<p>Since ODRL policies could deal with any kind of asset, the ODRL Information Model does not provide additional metadata to describe <code>Asset</code> entities of particular media types. It is recommended to use already existing metadata standards, such as <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/" rel="external nofollow">Dublin Core Metadata Terms</a> that are appropriate to the <code>Asset</code> type or purpose.</p>
<p>The <code>Relation</code> entity is used to associate the <code>Asset</code> entity with the relevant <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, and <code>Duty</code> entities</p>

<section id="relation">
<h4>Relation</h4>

<p>The <code>Relation</code> entity is an association class and can be used to link to an <code>Asset</code> from either <code>Permission</code>, <code>Duty</code> or <code>Prohibition</code>, indicating how the <code>Asset</code> MAY be utilised in respect to the entity that links to it.</p>
<p>The <code>Relation</code> entity contains the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>relation</code>: indicates the relationship of the <code>Asset</code> to the linked entity (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value for the <code>relation</code> attribute is <code>target</code> which indicates that the <code>Asset</code> is the primary object to which the <code>Permission</code>, <code>Duty</code> or <code>Prohibition</code> actions apply.</p>

<h3>Permission</h3>


<p>The <code>Permission</code> entity indicates the <code>Action</code>s that the <code>assignee</code> is permitted to perform on the associated <code>Asset</code>. In other words, what the <code>assigner</code> (supplier) has granted to the <code>assignee</code> (consumer).</p>
<p>An ODRL policy expression MAY contain at least one <code>Permission</code>. It is important to verify the semantics of the <code>Policy</code> <code>type</code> attribute as this MAY indicate additional constraints on the Policy expression structure.</p>
<p>If several <code>Permission</code> entities are referred to by a <code>Policy</code>, then <em>all of them</em> are valid.</p>
<p>The <code>Permission</code> entity has the following relations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Asset</code>: the <code>Permission</code> entity MUST refer to an <code>Asset</code> (where at least one, and only one, <code>relation</code> value is <code>target</code>) on which the linked <code>Action</code> MAY be performed (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>Action</code>: the <code>Permission</code> entity MUST refer to <em>exactly one</em> <code>Action</code> that indicates the granted operation on the target <code>Asset</code> (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>Party</code>: the <code>Permission</code> MUST refer to one or more <code>Party</code> entities linked via the <code>Role</code> entity (see Section 2.3.1) (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Constraint</code>: the <code>Permission</code> MAY refer to one or more <code>Constraint</code>s which affect the validity of the <code>Permission</code>, e.g. if the <code>Action</code> <code>play</code> is only permitted for a certain period of time (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>Duty</code>: the <code>Permission</code> MAY refer to one or more <code>Duty</code> entities that indicate a requirement that MAY be fulfilled in return for receiving the <code>Permission</code> (OPTIONAL)</li>

<h3>Duty</h3>

<p>A <code>Permission</code> entity MAY include a <code>Duty</code> entity that indicates a requirement that MUST be satisfied in order to undertake the <code>Permission</code>. A <code>Duty</code> MUST only be associated with a <code>Permission</code>. </p>
    
<p>Even though a <code>Duty</code> entity is mandatory, the ODRL model does not specify any conditions on <em>WHEN</em> the <code>Duty</code> <code>Action</code> MUST be performed. Such business rules MAY be expressed through additional <code>Constraint</code>s.  For example, a Policy may state that you can play a music file for a payment of $5.00. This does not indicate when the $5.00 should be paid, as different business rules may apply such as montly invoicing.</p>
    
<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The Party <code>http://example.com/assigner:sony</code> makes and <code>Offer</code> to <code>Play</code> the music file <code>http://example.com/music/1999.mp3</code>. There are two <code>Duties</code> that both must be satisfied for the <code>compensate</code> requirement. The first is the <code>payAmount</code> of $AUD5.00 and the second is the <code>event</code> of this <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/policyUsage</code> must not have occured yet.

When related to a <code>Prohibition</code>, the <code>Action</code> entity indicates the operations that the <code>assignee</code> (again the consumer) is <em>prohibited</em> to perform on the <code>Asset</code> linked to by <code>Prohibition</code>. Analogously, when related to a <code>Duty</code>, it indicates the operation to be performed.</p>
<p><code>Action</code> contains the following attribute:</p>

<li><code>name</code>: indicates the <code>Action</code> entity term (REQUIRED)</li>
</ul>
<p>As its value, the <code>name</code> attribute MAY take one of a set of <code>Action</code> <em>names</em> which are formally defined in profiles. The ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] defines a standard set of potential terms that MAY be used. Communities will develop new (or extend existing) profiles to capture additional and refined semantics.</p>

For example, the &#8220;number of usages&#8221; (<code>name</code>) must be &#8220;smaller than&#8221; (<code>operator</code>) the &#8220;number 10&#8221; (<code>rightOperand</code>).</p>
<p>If multiple <code>Constraint</code> entities are linked to the same <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, or <code>Duty</code> entity, then all of the <code>Constraint</code> entities MUST be satisfied. That is, all the <code>Constraint</code> entities are (boolean) <em>and</em>ed. In the case where the same <code>Constraint</code> is repeated, then these MUST be represented as a single <code>Constraint</code> entity using an appropriate <code>operator</code> value (for example, <code>isAnyOf</code>).</p>
<p>The <code>Constraint</code> entity contains the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code>: a name that identifies the left operand of the operation (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>operator</code>: an operator function (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>rightOperand</code>: the right operand of the operation (REQUIRED)</li>
<li><code>dataType</code>: the datatype of the rightOperand (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>unit</code>: the units of the rightOperand (OPTIONAL)</li>
<li><code>status</code>: the current value of the left operand (OPTIONAL)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>name</code> identifies the left operand of the mathematical operation for the <code>Constraint</code> such as &#8220;Number of Usages&#8221; and &#8220;Expiration Date&#8221; etc. The <code>operator</code> identifies the comparative operation such as &#8220;greater than&#8221; or &#8220;equal to&#8221;. The <code>rightOperand</code> identifies the value that is being compared. The <code>dataType</code> indicates the type of the <code>rightOperand</code>, such as &#8220;decimal&#8221; or &#8220;datetime&#8221; and the <code>unit</code> indicates the unit value of the <code>rightOperand</code>, such as &#8220;EU dollars&#8221;.</p>
<p>When processing policy expressions, these <code>Constraint</code> names MAY be directly linked to a procedure that can determine the outcome of the operations, such as the number of already performed usages and the current date. The <code>name</code> and <code>operator</code> are defined in the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] or ODRL Profiles.</p>
<p>The <code>status</code> provides the current value of the <code>Constraint</code> variable (i.e. current value of <code>name</code>). This is useful in cases where the current status of <code>Constraint</code>s needs to be captured and expressed in the ODRL Information Model.</p>

<p><b>Example Use Case</b>: The Party <code>http://example.com/myPix:6161</code> wants to assign the Permission distribute directly to the potential buyer of the permission who will pay 100 EUR for this grant. The distribute Permission is also constrained to a specific country, i.e., Italy. The potential assignee may then distribute the target Asset <code>http://example.com/wallpaper:1234</code> according to the nextPolicy target Asset linked directly from this Duty. In this case, the next Policy Asset stipulates that the potential assignee may only offer the display Permission to downstream consumers.</p>

<h2>ODRL Profiles</h2>

    <section id="profile-motivation">
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
        
<p>The ODRL Information Model serves as a framework to express Policies and the ODRL Vocabulary [[!vocab-odrl]] provides a broad range of common actions for Permissions, Prohibition, Duties as well as Policy Types, Constraint names, Asset relations, and Party roles. For communities that implement ODRL, the entire ODRL Information Framework and the entire Vocabulary would be too onerous when they will typically have very specific needs, as well as needs not covered by the ODRL vocabulary. </p>
<p>In these common cases, it is strongly recommended that a community create and formally document an ODRL Profile. An ODRL Profile will directly serve the communities needs by excluding features of the ODRL Information Model that they do not require (for example, inheritance) and specifying only the terms of the ODRL Vocabulary they wish to support. In addition, the ODRL Profile may include additional vocabulary terms specific to their community.</p>
        <p>The ODRL Profile may also include specific implementation details on how to determine the status and processing of Rules and Constraints. For example, the ODRL Profile may require the use of a thrid-party time-service to ensure temporal constraints are meet correctly (and will document the API details etc), or document the API to access values that need to be compared to the ODRL expression values (such as what location is the asset currently being used in).</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="profile-requirements">
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
      
<p>
    The <code>profile</code> attribute in the <code>Policy</code> entity is used to indicate the identifier (URI) of the ODRL Profile for which the policy expression conforms to. This attribute is OPTIONAL, but if the attribute appears, then any consuming system MUST understand the identified ODRL Profile and all the constraints in the ODRL Profile MUST apply to the policy expression. If a consuming system does not understand the ODRL Profile URI, then it MAY continue processing the policy expression, but it SHOULD NOT assume it has interpreted the policy expression correctly. </p>
    
    <p>If multiple ODRL Profiles are required, then it is recommended that a new identifier SHOULD be created to identify the combination of Profiles (and document the combined Profiles).</p>
<p>
The requirements for communities developing ODRL Profiles MUST document the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Any additions to the Information Model</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that will have different default values or (editorial) interpretations</li>
<li>Any aspects of the Information Model that is not being supported</li>
<li>New Vocabulary terms</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms not explicitly being suported</li>
<li>Vocabulary terms with more specific interpretations</li>
<li>The ODRL Profile identifier (URI)</li>
    </ul>
  
<p>The community SHOULD also create a machine-readable schema for their ODRL Profile following the appropriate serialisations options outlined in the ODRL Vocabulary and Expression specification [[!vocab-odrl]]. In this case, the ODRL Profile URI MUST also be used as the serialisation namespace URI.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to share the ODRL Profile with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/odrl/">W3C ODRL Community Group</a> for feedback and comments. In addition, the W3C ODRL Community Group may host the ODRL Profile documents on their website. </p>
    </section>
    
<section id="profile-example">
    <h3>Profile Examples</h3>
<p>
An example ODRL Profile - called RightsML [[rights-ml]] was developed by the <a href="https://www.iptc.org">International Press and Telecommuncations Council</a> for the communication of usage policies, primarily in association with the licensed distribution and use of news content by news gathering agencies, publishers, licensing organisations, business intermediaries and business consumers in the online news market-place. The RightsML ODRL Profile clearly documented:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>which features of the ODRL Information Model were supported,</li>
    <li>the supported policy types,</li>
    <li>the exact list of actions to be supported for Permissions,</li>  
    <li>more refined definitions of some ODRL vocabulary terms, and</li>
    <li>additional actions and constraints (specific to the News industry).</li>
</ul>
    
    <p>The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) developed a comprehensive ODRL Profile for the mobile community. Although it was based on the ODRL Version 1.1 specification [[odrl]], the documentation included detailed specifications on the ODRL vocabulary to be supported, new and refined terms, a protocol to exchange ODRL Expressions (over mobile phones), and the relevant encoding schemas. The documentation is available here [[oma-profile]].</p>

<h2>Experimental Features</h2> 
        
   <div class="issue" data-number="63">
        <p>Modified verions of Extended Relations will be incorporated into the Model</p>

<section id="extended-relations">
<h3>Extended Relations</h3>
<p><code>Extended Relations</code> may tie <code>Permission</code>, <code>Prohibition</code>, <code>Duty</code>, and <code>Constraint</code> entities together with an <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code> or <code>XOR</code> relationship. Only entities of the same type can be linked with this model. For example, a <code>Permission</code> and <code>Prohibition</code> cannot be linked together within this model. The Extended Relations model supports the following attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>operation</code>: may be set with <em>one</em> of the mathematical values <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code> and <code>XOR</code>. (<code>OR</code> is the default if not specified.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following table outlines the semantics of Extended Relations with respect to each of the main entity types.</p>

<table class="simple">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>Permission</code></td>
<td><code>Prohibition</code></td>
<td><code>Duty</code></td>
<td><code>Constraint</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>OR</code></td>
<td>The related party may perform <em>any</em> (<em>at least</em>) one of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MAY NOT perform <em>at least</em> one of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MUST perform <em>at least</em> one of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related <code>Permission</code>/<code>Prohibition</code>/<code>Duty</code> is restricted by <em>at least</em> one of the <code>Constraint</code>s</td>
</tr>
    
<tr>
<td><code>AND</code></td>
<td>The related party MUST perform <em>all</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MAY NOT perform <em>all</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MUST perform <em>all</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related <code>Permission</code>/<code>Prohibition</code>/<code>Duty</code> is restricted by <em>all</em> of the <code>Constraint</code>s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>XOR</code></td>
<td>The related party MAY perform only <em>one</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MAY NOT perform only <em>one</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related party MUST perform only <em>one</em> of the <code>Action</code>s</td>
<td>The related <code>Permission</code>/<code>Prohibition</code>/<code>Duty</code> is restricted by only <em>one</em> of the <code>Constraint</code>s.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that Extended Relations are not needed to assign two or more <code>Permission</code>s to a <code>Party</code> entity. In this case simply use as many <code>Assignee</code> relations between <code>Party</code> and <code>Permission</code> as needed.</p>
