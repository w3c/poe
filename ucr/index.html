All use cases provide realistic examples describing how people and organisations may (or want to be able to) specify statements about digital content usage. The requirements derived from these use cases will be used to guide the development of the POE WG recommendation deliverables for the Information Model, Vocabulary and Encodings. </p>

					used to capture and model functional requirements. Use cases
					describe the system’s behavior under various conditions [[COCKBURN-2000]],
					cataloging who does what with the system, for what purpose, but
					without concern for system design or implementation. Each use case is identified by a
					reference number to aid cross-reference from other documentation. A variety of styles may be used to capture use cases,
					from a simple narrative to a structured description with actors,
					pre/post conditions, and non-functional requirements
					raised by the use case.

For example, given a dataset, one might want to serve it under the following conditions: "Anybody can access named graph ex:graph1, but can only access ex:graph2 during 2016. Individual triples in ex:graph3 can be accessed at the price of 1 eur cent."

							<li>The range of syntactically valid expressions is too large to grant that any valid expression will be parsed. This is promising too much. A more constrained syntax is needed (avoiding recursions, a limit in the nested elements, etc.)</li>

Even within this latter group, there are a range of different licensing schemes and access mechanisms which are not mutually-exclusive. For queries against the index to return appropriate results for a user, we must track which schemes they (or their institution) is a member of and filter based upon these, which therefore translates into a requirement for the metadata being indexed to include information identifying which are applicable (we term these "audience URIs"). Note that this is not an access-control mechanism (this should be implemented and enforced at the media location), rather a means of ensuring that an optimal user experience is delivered.

					<div class="visible uc"> <p>In the news industry, rights holders and editors need to establish the permissions and restrictions associated with content.</p>
					<p>
					<dl>
					<dt>What Do Rights Holders Want?</dt><dd> In general, rights holders will require that a set of permissions, restrictions, and duties be obeyed for a defined set of content. And they can require additional restrictions or duties for individual items within the larger content set. Rights holders wish to restrict the use of their content by factors such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Geography (e.g. "No use in China")</li>
						<li>Time (e.g. "No archive after 3 days")</li>
						<li>Distribution channel (e.g. "No mobile")</li>
					</ul>
					They also want to enforce duties such as:
					<ul>
						<li>Payment (e.g. "You can use this photo online for EUR80")</li>
						<li>Attribution (e.g. "Credit Kyoto News")</li>
					</ul>
					Often, rights holders need to constrain the use of their content in complex ways, i.e., with combined constraints (e.g, "No use in UK after 7 days").
					Generally, rights holders want to be able to:
					<dl>
					  <dt>Create a bundle of permissions, restrictions and duties</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder creates a set of permissions and restrictions with constraints, together with any duties that the editor must perform, in order to unlock the permissions. The set may be associated with one or more sets of content. Therefore the policy bundle must have a unique identifier. </dd>
					  <dt>Identify one or more items of content to be treated as a set</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder defines one or more content items which are to be treated as a set. The set must have a unique identifier.</dd>
					  <dt>Bind a policy to a set of content</dt>
						<dd>The rights holder asserts that a given set of content is governed by a given policy. Note that a given content item might be a member of more than one set of content. Therefore, a given content item may have more than one policy associated with it. </dd>
					</dl></dd>
					
					
					<!--</p>-->
					<dt>What Do Editors Want?</dt><dd> Ideally, not to worry about rights at all. Essentially, editors want to know the answer to the question "Can I use this content in this way?" and, if the answer is yes, "Are there any duties?". It is not unusual for editors to have access to content that they are not permitted to republish. Or that they can only republish in certain ways (e.g., only in print but not on a mobile app). Editors want to be able to:
					<dl>
					  <dt>Create a bundle of action and context"</dt>
						<dd>An editor identifies a content use in context, meaning a particular action they propose to take with pieces of content (e.g. "print", "distribute", "archive") and any relevant context for that action (e.g. location="France"). The types of context for an action correspond to possible constraints which could apply to the use of a piece of content. The use is not tied to one particular piece of content. The use must have a unique identifier. </dd>
					 <dt>Determine whether a use is permitted for a particular content item</dt>
					 <dd>At the point where an Editor wishes to use a particular piece of content in a particular way, the policies must be evaluated to determine whether it is permitted and whether there are any duties that must be fulfilled. The possible results are therefore: "yes", "no" or "maybe". </dd>
