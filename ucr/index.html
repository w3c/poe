							Different Language Resource Catalogs exist, like the one of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a>, or the one of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://metashare.elda.org/">META-SHARE</a>, LRMAP, Linghub, etc.
							These resources need to be browsed and queried, and the permissions information must be in a machine-readable form in order to facilitate search-by-permission and in order to allow the automated processing of permission expressions.

Availability depend on ODRL policies, the context and the ODRL Request and ODRL Ticket. For example, given a dataset, one might want to serve it under the following conditions: "Anybody can access named graph ex:graph1, but can only access ex:graph2 during 2016. Individual triples in ex:graph3 can be accessed at the price of 1 eur cent."

							<li> The CRUD operations should be unequivocally described (i.e., only one term to declare "Read" access, and not the many that now could be interpreted). Maybe also in tighter relationship with the Linked Data Platform vocabulary.</li>
							<li>Richer manners of expressing payments and prices are required. </li>
							<li>The range of syntactically valid expressions is too large to grant that any valid expression will be parsed. This is promising too much. A more constrained syntax is needed (avoiding recursions, a limit in the nested elements, etc.)</li>
							<li>It should be possible to declare default policies for actions (e.g., if nothing is said about 'delete', then allow 'delete', etc.).</li>

The purpose of the embargo period is to allow the researcher or research team creating the dataset to have a publication based on it published before colleagues can access the dataset and generate their own publications.

A specific usage of such a kind of texts is that of manually extracting the set of obliged/prohibited/permitted actions in order to check whether certain business processes are compliant with the legal text they should refer to.

					<div class="visible uc"> <p>The Research & Education Space platform, developed jointly by the BBC and partners, indexes Linked Open Data describing media that is available both to the public, and specifically for those in formal education, primarily in the UK. Even within this latter group, there are a range of different licensing schemes and access mechanisms which are not mutually-exclusive. For queries against the index to return appropriate results for a user, we must track which schemes they (or their institution) is a member of and filter based upon these, which therefore translates into a requirement for the metadata being indexed to include information identifying which are applicable (we term these "audience URIs"). Note that this is not an access-control mechanism (this should be implemented and enforced at the media location), rather a means of ensuring that an optimal user experience is delivered.

Rather than attempt to make assertions about what an end user can or cannot do with the data available through its API, OpenPHACTS is careful to simply make clear to its users where data came from and under what terms.

					<div class="visible uc"> <p>In the News Industry, Rights Holders and Editors need to establish the permissions and restrictions associated with content.</p>
					<p><strong>What Do Rights Holders Want?</strong> In general, Rights Holders will require that a set of permissions, restrictions and duties be obeyed for a defined set of content. And they can require additional restrictions or duties for individual items within the larger content set. Rights Holders wish to restrict the use of their content by such factors as:
					<ul>
						<li>Geography (e.g. "No use in China")</li>
						<li>Time (e.g. "No archive after 3 days")</li>
						<li>Distribution channel (e.g. "No mobile")</li>
					</ul>
					They also want to enforce duties such as
					<ul>
						<li>Payment (e.g. "You can use this photo online for EUR80")</li>
						<li>Attribution (e.g. "Credit Kyoto News")</li>
					</ul>
					Often Rights Holders need to constrain the use of their content in complex ways, i.e. with combined constraints. For example, "No use in UK after 7 days".</p>
					<p><strong>What Do Editors Want?</strong> Ideally, not to worry about rights… Essentially, Editors want to know the answer to the question "Can I use this content in this way?" and, if the answer is yes, "Are there any duties?". It is not unusual for Editors to have access to content that they are not permitted to republish. Or that they can only republish in certain ways (e.g. only in print but not on a mobile app).
